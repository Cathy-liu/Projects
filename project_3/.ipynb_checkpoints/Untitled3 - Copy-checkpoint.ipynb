       "Hi, not really sure where to ask this question but was hoping someone here might have knowledge about this. \\n\\nWas looking at limits of bringing alcohol to Spain. I saw an EU website that I think was saying you can bring 1 litre of spirits over 22% abv.\\n\\nDoes that mean there's no limit for 22% and under?\\n\\nThe alcohol I wanted to bring is exactly 22% and two litres of it. Does anyone know if that'll be okay?\\n\\nThanks for reading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "Early 20's couple going on a trip to Kosovo in mid-september, and I'm looking for tips on what to do there. \\n\\nI got the tickets spontaneously and don't know much about the country. We traveled to Bulgaria last year and loved it, I figure we're in for something similar culturally speaking?\\n\\nOur plans are totally open, I suppose a few days in Pristina and the rest in the mountains, do suggest if you have ideas. \\n\\n* We decided on sticking with public transport, how difficult is getting around the country (for example, Pristina -&gt; Peja -&gt; Prizren etc.)?\\n* What kind of weather can I expect? Should I expect a lot of rain and overcast?\\n* What kind of \"action\" activities can I find in the mountains? Cycling and ziplining is always fun.\\n* Is weed easily available there, if I were to get say, a few grams?\\n* Restaurants or dishes that I have to try before leaving Kosovo?       1\n",
