5,Another plateau question,So I started IF low carb and low calorie intake about 2 months ago. I went from 2.5k calories a day to 1.5k. The first month I lost around 15 pounds but I've been stuck at around 230 ever since. Did I cut too much out too fast?,intermittentfasting,1620122656
8,Struggling but grateful for this group,"Hello follow IFers.  I've been slipping a bit these past two weeks:  opening my feeding window an hour early, snacking too much, eating too much carbs, skipping my workouts due to hunger.  Consequently, my weight inched up and my neuropathy came back.  Well, back on the short and narrow.

11,Looking for methods that can prevent hunger pangs and gastritis.,"I'm 38 y.o. male, standing at 170cm and weighing 74kg at the moment. Two years ago, I managed to lose weight from 79kg to 63kg, but during the pandemic lockdowns since last year, I have regained weight.  
  
I am starting to feel the burden of getting fatter and I wish to get a lean body again. However, in recent months I noticed that I have hunger pangs whenever meal time comes. I am eating 3 meals a day now, and I have to eat or the hunger will make me feel very terrible and unable to focus.  
  
I understand that I have to keep my calorie intake lower than my sedentary calorie needs, but I have difficulty looking for very filling food that is low in calorie. I can't go on long hours without food as I might get gastritis.

27,'Sugar is Poison' - A personal journal entry documenting the fasting journey that I thought some others may find valuable.,"Hello Friends,

Second day showing up, I am proud. 

The first and most important thing I'd like to note is that it is much, much easier to show up and do things when I have a low carb, high fat diet and have been fasting. Not only was I looking forward to sitting down and write this, but I also just finished a 6km run (14 hour fasted state). My last run also coincided with fasting (not much of a coincidence, really).

This have been well documented, I have read and heard it everywhere, and I have now experienced it personally several times. Grain Brain is real (and the title of a book that I have not read but is most certainly on my to read list). 

I can also certify that the other well documented phenomena of taking one day off and going three days backwards is also accurate. 

Why then, if these things are well documented and I have experienced it several times, do I keep going off track? 

The best way I can explain it is through 'differential mental states/settings environments'. What I mean by that is that our perception is warped by our current mental state, distorting any actions related to the actions we want to accomplish. 

This phenomena occurs in both directions: after several days of fasting, low carb, and exercise which lead to ketosis and feeling superhuman, it is easy to underestimate the threat of the damn carbs. 

After all, one is looking and feeling great and definitely convinced that one have struck the best lifestyle and one does not need to be convinced to stick to it. 

However, once those dreaded carbs enter the body, sugar unleashes their demonic powers. Hijacking the neural pathways, triggering insulin and supplying weapons to the rioting gut bacteria who will make our life hell until we pay the extortion. With a clear mind we are able to rationalise that ONE more hit won't hurt, as we can always go back to being healthy the next day. 

The problem is, that with every day that passes, the ability to break the cycle becomes harder. Worse, the ability to do ANYTHING is gone. Both motivation and cognitive performance are lost among a grain fuelled brain fog. 

Sluggishness makes us fall behind in life (work, study), which only fuels the cycle of prioritising 'getting things done' instead of getting back on our healthy streak. It is easier to feed the monster and 'power' through (struggle)work while eating a muffin than it is to take the time to reflect on one's choices, goals, and develop the mental fortitude to fight the *temporary* cravings that will allow us to excel once again.",intermittentfasting,1620084517

37,Dangers of OMAD?,"Hi guys,

I've been very excited to start my OMAD journey. Its been a week and while some days are hard, its been really great so far! I've fasted before and so decided to go all in with OMAD. I have been eating super healthy when I do eat and get full. I usually eat around 5 or 7, and start feeling hungry at 3pm. I stopped craving unhealthy foods and sugar.

I talked to a nutritionist today because I wanted to make sure I was being healthy. And I felt totally shamed! She made me feel like I am buying into doet culture and risk an eating disorder. Despite telling her thats what I wanted to avoid hence wanting advice on making sure I can maintain a OMAD lifestyle.

I want to do OMAD for the rest of my life with exceptions for big events/special occasions.

How long can someone maintain an OMAD lifestyle and how to you ensure you are eating all your vitamins?

As an example:yesterday I had half a plate of homemade ceviche, two carrots, two celery, some broccoli, a few whole wheat tortillas chips, a smootie (one whole orange, half a papaya and some pineapple). And I felt super full after.

As I get closer to my goal I'm trying to visualize what this new lifestyle looks like in maintenance mode. Do I have to change what I'm doing? I've gotten used to having extra time and not stressing about what to eat but maybe if have less fat to fuel myself with I would be more interested in food.

It's hard to wind down and feel 'normal' after that. (takes about 1 hr, 30 min. to pass) I was discussing with a friend, and she says that going without food for any prolonged time at my weight is unsafe, I could be harming myself and I should try to eat more often, and another says this is actually a very healthy way to eat and helps cell regeneration and detoxing, etc.

Noob here. This is my first post, so just want to share some thoughts of joy. 

H: 191cm/6,27, SW: 148kg/325pounds, GW: 109kg/239pounds, CW: 142,6kg/39,1pounds.

My first 24 hours fast completed tonight, and I'm sooo happy! I started with IF just last week; went quite quickly from 16:8 to 20:4, just to try it out, and I felt really good. Then, I had a break during weekend, and regained more than I expected. Last night at [8pm](https://8.pm), I sat the timer in Zero to 16:8, but I planned to go for as long as it felt ""good"", but to have a meal at [8pm](https://8.pm) again, since I want to start slowly and no longer than 24 hours too quick. Well, 24 hours went without problems, apart from cold hands and feet at one point, but a walk and electrolytes fixed that. 

At 8pm, I had a smoothie, a salad and about 1/4 of a chicken (drumstick, thigh and wing), and that meal tasted better than anything I have eaten for as long as I can remember. I have also started mindful eating when I end a fast, and it's a new, enjoyable experience for me. 

I love this. I love the way Dr. Jason Fung has changed my life, and I look forward to see where I am in six months time. I have never really been happy about my weight, and I have never felt satisfied after a meal/snack/drink/cigarette... I've always had an urge for something, and never been able to understand exactly what... I've smoked a lot, and drunken even more alcohol (almost daily for many years). Now, like magic, I suddenly feel calm, satisfied and complete.",intermittentfasting,1620072343

46,Did IF for over a month. Lost 5kg (11lbs) Stopped IF for a week. Gained 3kg(6.6lbs). Feeling discouraged but sharing non-scale victories and needing advice.,"I stopped IFing on the 23rd of April because I had hit a plateau for a few days and I thought I would get out of it by shaking things up a bit. Then one weekend turned into 8 days and here I am today, one week later and 3kgs (6,6lbs) heavier. 

When I started my weight loss (January) I was at 80 kg (176 lbs) Then I got down to 75 kg (165 lbs) just by eating a bit better and that‚Äôs when I started IF, which brought me down to 70.5kg (155 lbs) in a little over a month. 

It was at that weight (70.5kg/155lbs) that I decided to eat a bit more. During these past 8 days I did not exercise much, ate more than usual (but no binges) and drank less water.

Today I weigh 73.5 (172 lbs) and I was feeling really discouraged this morning but now I want to start IF again. I went on a 5km walk and am waiting for two more hours until I can break my fast that I started yesterday. 

I guess even though I gained 3kg (6.6lbs) I do have some non-scale victories to share. During this past week I didn‚Äôt crave sweets as much as before, I knew when to stop eating because now I recognize when I am hungry vs. bored, and I acknowledged that certain foods I used to love are actually not that healthy and make me feel bloated. I didn‚Äôt overeat those foods. I‚Äôm actually proud of myself for being able to stop when I noticed these things.

However, I am worried about these 3kg (6.6 lbs) I gained.

Do you think they are all fat? Can it also be water retention due to higher salt consumption?
How long will it take me to get back to my previous weight?

I want to be at 68kg (149 lbs) by the end of May, because this would mean I‚Äôd be at a healthy BMI.  I am 166 cm tall (5ft 4in)

Do you think that is possible? What do you recommend?

Want to start by saying thank you. I'm in this subreddit daily reading all of your posts and gaining inspiration from your progress pics. Thank you!

It's crazy how flexible IF is.  From having a bit too much beer on a weekend (and seeing no weight loss due to it), to havening yo travel for a funeral, I've been able to make focused decisions more about when I eat, and not as much about what I eat (within reason). 

I've yoyo'd so many times before, usually with extreme weight loss, but not seen this healthy level of weight loss week over week.  Feeling amped!

So, to celebrate, today I'm doing my first 24 hour fast (currently 20 hours in).  I hope in the coming month I can plan out a 36 hour fast to prove to myself how strong I can be when it comes to changing food habits.

62,Nailed my goal yesterday! Then I ate all the things.,"*IF since mid-February 2021, SW 269, CW 231.3, GW 230.*

I weighed in at 229.4 yesterday which was a satisfying accomplishment.  I then did this:

1. Ate my normal breakfast, but still felt a little bit hungry.
2. Ate a ""second breakfast"" of some homemade Korean BBQ and entered a food coma.
3. Wasn't hungry again until the afternoon, and ate a small sandwich.  Still within 16:8 feed window.
4. Got munchy during normal fast window and ate two hands full of pistachios.  No guilt, man.
5. Family friend came over bearing homemade delicacies.  Debated briefly then ate one [Chinese hot dog bun](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-hot-dog-buns/).  Ignored the rest.
6. Wife called late evening and asked me to put the gift food in the fridge.  I looked at the cheesecake, thought it looked too good to pass up, and ate one before putting the rest in the fridge.  It was tiny, about 1/3 of the typical American cheesecake.  Still felt a little guilty.
7. Went to bed late.  

I knew I would go back up on the scale, but this is not discouraging me.  I likely retained water for all the new carbs I don't usually eat plus drinking a LOT of Diet Pepsi throughout the day yesterday.

This was essentially my third cheat day in 10 weeks.  Previously one was a homemade BBQ ribs dinner with my parents, and the other a child's birthday celebration at Olive Garden.  I carefully adjusted my meals around those events and didn't gain weight.  Yesterday was my first DGAF cheat day, and all things considered I could have snacked on far, far worse things.

Back on the horse!  Before, I was doing 16:8 that often turned into 20:4, but I felt my strength endurance fading in the end.  Losing 3-4 pounds a week is draining.  I think this time I'll do a more traditional 16:8 that is probably two full meals and an optional snack.  I will also try to do TDEE calculations to feed my workouts correctly.

New goal!  Stretch goal of 215 but at about 1-2 pounds a week by... August 1.  Truth be told if I stay below 230 and work on rebuilding strength, that's just hunky dory.  215 will just get me to a weight I haven't seen in 18 years.",intermittentfasting,1620058090

68,Can I do IF while breastfeeding?,"So I‚Äôm currently breastfeeding my 9 month old son and I‚Äôd like to lose some weight (around 5-8kg) before summer. I am quite tempted to do 2 months of 20:4  but I‚Äôm concerned whether it will affect my milk supply or not. 

Some precisions : If you‚Äôre worried about my baby becoming underfed due to my caloric restrictions let me put your worries to rest: our pediatrician believes he‚Äôs already too heavy (13kg) and told us to cut my milk with water (he refuses the bottle so it‚Äôs no use). 
So if I start producing skimmed milk thanks to IF it will not harm my boy, on the contrary, but it will help him slim down a bit.

73,"My progress seems to have been exceptionally rapid, now my friends have me worried about it. Please read the post and let me know your opinion.","I (21M, 188 cm/6 foot 2 inches tall) unknowingly started IF on 14 March, 2021. Unknowingly because I had no idea that there was something called IF and that I was following one of its routines (16:8). My weight then was 89.1 kg (196.43 lbs). 

Seven weeks have passed since I started, and my weight now is 80.7 kg (177.91 lbs). I weigh myself strictly on Sundays only (it messes with my mind and ruins my focus if I do it every day), and I've noticed my weight loss rate has been more or less consistent at 1 kg (2.20 lbs) per week, except 2 weeks when it was more than that.

Now, I feel great myself: no weakness, no sense of starving, no irritation. However, when I told my ignorant (about IF) friends (2 of whom are like the ""fitness freaks"" of my gang) about what I was doing, they accuses me of starving myself and said that I was losing a lot of muscle, along with the fat. They also said that 1 kg (2.20 lbs) or more per week was an exceptionally fast weight loss rate, and almost certainly a large portion of it had to be muscle. 

Here are my observations from this period.

1. I don't *feel* like I'm starving myself. If I were, I would've felt it, right? But I feel just fine; in fact, I feel better than I've ever felt! I'm light and active and agile throughout the day and my mind is also quick and attentive.

2. I do bodyweight exercises 4 days a week. They're not much: mostly just push ups, hollow body crunches, and squats. I also have a pair of dumbbells and I do bicep curls with them. 

The number of push ups I can do in one go has gone up from 1 to 7 (slow push ups with perfect form!). My bicep curls have also progressed: I started with lighter weights and now I lift heavier ones with more or less the same amout of ease. 

But if I was losing so much muscle (as my friends suggest), then my strength wouldn't have increased, right? 

Please tell my your opinion on this.

Also, this sub is fantastic and has played a tremendous role in motivating me to keep going, so thanks to all those who post their progress pictures or positive experiences after succeeding!",intermittentfasting,1620043082

76,Fasting post-COVID.,"Hi, I adopted intermittent fasting (mostly 16-8) with reduced carbs as a lifestyle last year, and have been very happy with how it made me look and feel.

Two weeks ago I contracted COVID-19, and its been super exhausting. I didnt fast because I felt so weak and needed to eat regularly.. i am struggling to figure out how to proceed from here.

My symptoms are gone but I am still super weak, should I wait a little more before returning to IF, or would it be better to restart with 14 hour fasts and increase gradually?",intermittentfasting,1620037124
84,"33M, 5'9"", SW:243 lbs, CW:213lbs, GW:161lbs - One Week Later","So I've been fasting on 16:8 since 22 April, a little over a week.

Before IF, my weight loss had stalled, my willpower was sapped and was back to comfort eating.

Lockdown and a new baby had got my eating habits and exercise routine totally knocked out of sync and I'd worked my way back up to 243lbs through being lazy and ignorant. As my son grew bigger, it was getting harder to carry him and I realised by the time he was a toddler I'd either be stuck at 243lbs or getting increasingly heavier. Lockdown meant I didn't have to see anyone so had stopped worrying about fitting into normal clothes. Jogging bottoms and baggy t-shirts were the order of the day.

Through managing my diet and exercise I'd managed to get back down to 216lbs and then it all stalled when baby's sleeping habits switched up at 12 months. I started with an extra pound, then an extra two, and so on. Before long, I was back up in the 220s and losing faith in the in my ability to stick to the plan. Any hope of routinely exercising were going out the window. 

After finally biting the bullet on IF and just getting started (not waiting for a Monday, or 'once those snacks have been eaten') I'm happy to report I am currently 6lbs down. I weigh myself every Monday as a reminder to keep an eye on progress but already I am feeling that IF is changing my relationship with food. I don't feel like I am starving or denying myself, I'm not craving things and actually having a finite point in the day to say 'enough, no more eating' is helping me understand what hunger is and how a rumbling stomach is not going to end me. 

Thank you for everyone participating in this community. I have yet to take any 'before' photos but will try and get this done today so that when I finally reach my GW (and I now have confidence that I will) there can be another success story and hopefully it inspires someone just as I was inspired.",intermittentfasting,1620023439
85,Midnight beer = OMAD?,"I've been doing IF for almost a week, my first week. It's not actually that difficult so far and I've been very disciplined eating from midday to 8pm. But last night I went out to watch a game of football with a mate (1am in my country). I decided to have a beer, knowing it would restart my fast just 5 hours into my fasting window. Thought to make up for that I've now gone a further 16 hours to see through my complete fast. So by the time I eat (probably in about 75 mins or so) I will have gone 22 hours without food, despite having a beer in between. I'm pretty proud of it but can't help being annoyed that the damn beer in between has ruined the achievement at least in my mind. Anyone else experienced this?",intermittentfasting,1620022886
86,Blood sugar dropped,"I did an unplanned 23 hour fast, and then 16:8. I woke up in the morning of the 16:8 (I definitely did not get much calories in the 8 hrs. I went pretty hard in that time period at gym).

My blood sugar was so low I was terrified. I could not walk straight, fell, dizzy, etc.

So I broke the fast early with some fruit. I didn't fast for a few days because I was very anxious.

Just started again - I have a problem where I don't remember to eat in my eating window.

Is there anything healthy yet able to maintain a  normal blood sugar I can incorporate into my meals?

Tried getting outside, walking, driving around, but I just see a McDonald's and suddenly I'm thinking about cheeseburgers.

120,Today was a good day - I started out less than a week ago and I am amazed!! M30 | 6'0 | CW 231lbs | GW 187 | flexible plan,"Hey everyone,

I've been eyeing IF for quite some time now since I first heard of it when I was heavily into weightliftig. What kept me from trying it out was mostly that I feared my performance in the gym might decline if I was working out in a fasting period. I just couldn't imagine being able to lift the same weights when I wasn't loaded on carbs. I did Carb Backloading for some time, which was great but I heavily overdid it with 4,000 kcal per day (plus, I spent a fortune on Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream).

Fast forward to last year - a friend of mine got me into mountain biking and I love it. What I did notice though was that if I was riding more than 30 miles and/or intensive climbs, I somehow felt weak and shaky when I wasn't eating enough.

So last week I finally started IF with 16:8 but quickly felt that I could easily extend my fasting periods. One day I managed to go 23:1 and wasn't even hungry! My relationship with food changed a lot recently. I still love cooking and eating, but I do it way more conciously now. I'm not feeling really hungry anymore, I don't crave food and desserts like I used to, and it just feels amazing!

Today I went on a mountain bike trip with a friend of mine. I packed some food in case I lack the power to pedal uphill or get shaky. We started at 11 AM and I only had a cup of coffee. First part of the trip was an intensive climb of 1800 ft. After about one hour we reached the top of the mountain and it felt great! I had the usual power, wasn't feeling weak and even then I didn't even consider having a bite or two (my mate however destroyed his lunch pack in an instant lol). The descent was a scenic technical trail with some speed sections in between. Back home, still not hungry - but I had a sandwich nonetheless.

IF brought me great things so far:

* My relationship with food improved **a lot**!
* I feel that I am in control over when, what and how much I eat.
* I can still shred on the bike, even on an empty stomach and it feels amazing! (but still: *HOW?!*)

Time to get rid of that dad bod now.

I've been testing and working out at around 11pm and then have 4 eggs + a piece of meat if there are leftovers from the day before.

My question is: Because I like to lift weights and workout, what would benefit me more: To increase my eating window by an hour or two to have a breakfast high in protein, or to workout just before lunch were I usually have a lot more meat + protein? or is it ok to eat 1 or 2 hours after working out? what has worked best for you? thanks!",intermittentfasting,1619965644

Background- 6‚Äô0 21 year old male who weighs 135 pounds. I don‚Äôt take any medications and have never once in my life. I smoke occasionally but that‚Äôs about it when it comes to substances 

Unlike a lot of people here, I don‚Äôt do it to lose weight as I‚Äòve weighed 135 the past 4 years. (I have an extremely high metabolism so gaining weight is almost impossible for me)
It started when I graduated high school and moved out. 

For some reason out of nowhere I only felt the urge to eat at night and didn‚Äôt feel hungry in the day time. I have a twin brother and he  started doing it naturally too.

I‚Äôve found a lot of benefits to it but I‚Äôm probably not getting the most from them as my diet is pretty shit consisting of pizza, eggs, ben and jerry‚Äôs, rice and chicken, and cereal (basically the college diet) 

- anyways doing it for 3 years, my life has definitely changed. one being not tied down to food and thinking I have to stop what I‚Äôm doing to make a meal. Saves me a lot of time during the day.

- never tired anymore which is honestly annoying sometimes because i‚Äôll try to nap on days I don‚Äôt get much sleep‚Äî- i‚Äôve taken maybe 3-5 naps over the past year

- don‚Äôt need as much sleep. i used to have to get 8 hours of sleep a night otherwise i‚Äôd feel tired and groggy but now i can function quite well off any amount of sleep without feeling crazy lol

waking up right away has also been one of the things i‚Äôve noticed the most. when i wake up, i get right out of bed with a lot more clarity than what i used to. 

- wayyy more energy. before i started doing it, my energy levels were all over the place... tired some days and high the next. i‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôre a lot more consistent

- better focus. even though I have ADHD, intermittent fasting has probably helped the most with it. i went from falling asleep in class daily and no focus whatsoever, to actually paying attention and getting better grades 

-#1 benefit for me so far though has definitely been anxiety. In high school I had a really bad panic attack problem -for almost 6 months straight when i was 16, i had a panic attack everyday because I thought i was dying from a heart attack. 

I‚Äôm a hypochondriac and didn‚Äôt know i was until i had panic attacks everyday. anyways it got better but lasted until i moved out. since i moved out ive only had a handful of them which is a huge improvement.
even when I do have anxiety, i know how to handle it now and don‚Äôt freak out like i used to. 
my anxiety levels went from a 9 daily to about a 2


this might not relevant to everyone here but i also stopped watching porn 5 months ago which was also life changing. that shit wrecks your brain. so maybe that‚Äôs helped too idk 




there are a few side effects like irritability some days, irregular sleeping patterns, and loss of hunger but other than that it‚Äôs been good and i‚Äôll probably be doing this for the rest of my life so yeah definitely give it a try if you haven‚Äôt yet.",intermittentfasting,1619946021

I've been doing 16:8 for almost four months. A month in, I've been stuck with a lot tight muscles. I wake up every day with pain and low energy which makes it hard to get myself going right away. I've lost confidence in PT recommended exercises because they always seem to make me feel worse. Even with a cup of coffee, I can't get myself going. I usually wake up at 8.  I end up having to wait all morning until 11 comes so I can have my breakfast, which picks up my energy and relieves my tightness. It sucks that I can't take pain relievers because of having an empty stomach. I feel like my days go too quick before I have to drop everything to have dinner before my 7 pm cutoff. It seems now that my weight has stopped dropping. It's hard to eat as low carb as I want because of kitchen renovation chaos. I don't feel in control of my environment and diet, even though I have stuck strong to my eating windows. Would the splash of cream in my coffee be affecting my ketosis or the few alcoholic drinks I have be affecting my progress?

I'm 11 weeks postpartum and the heaviest I've ever been at 250lbs and 5'5. I'm feeling deflated. Before I got pregnant I had lost almost 2 stone doing IF (but was in the middle of a plateau and not losing) and now I'm 30lbs over my pre pregnancy weight. 

I want to lose that 30lbs and then ideally would like to lose 30-50lbs more. It feels like an overwhelming challenge to me. I just can't see myself ever being able to do it or ever being a normal weight as I've been overweight (but not massively) since my early teens. I seem to have this mental block that is telling me I'll never do it because I've always been this way and I'll be stuck at 250lbs forever. Or I'll do it, lose a bit and then just put it back on. It's like my mind isn't allowing myself the possibility that I could be a normal weight, like I can't let go of myself this way. Which is bizarre as I would really love to get my weight down at this point for my son, I just can't see it happening.

231,"Some Questions About Doing OMAD: Safety, Calories, Vaccine"," HI everyone,

I am 29 male and 6'0. Currently 195 lbs. I've reached a plateau on my weight loss journey. I have no specific hard weight loss goal. But maybe 175 lbs if I had to put a number to it.

I'm in the middle of a cut. I currently do a PPL workout 3 days a week, and I do 20 minute HIIT cycling 4 times a week. Right now my macros are 1500 cals, 113g carbs, 33g fat, 188g protein.

I have a few questions as I'm considering doing OMAD/23:1:

* So if I do OMAD, do I eat all my cals and macros in that one meal? Through all the stuff over the years I heard that it's dangerous for a guy of my size to eat less that 1500 a day. But reading/lurking on here I found threads where people say they don't even count their calories.
* I know I'll eat a fair bit for that one meal and that will include leafy greens, other veggies, fruits, whole grains, lean protein. Stuff I already eat a fair amount. But If I don't count calories, is ""Ketoade"" the ""supplement"" that I drink to assure that I get necessary nutrients?
* I plan on getting my 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on 5/21. I know that if you're fasting that after getting the vaccine you should cut your fast to help your immune system. Is that only for Water fasting or would also include OMAD/23:1?
* Are there any recommendations of a fast friendly preworkout other than just plain coffee? The way my schedule works out I have to workout early in the AM around 5. I'm gonna try and eat my meal for the day for lunch. I'm not a big preworkout guy but on the rare occasions if I do go lift/cycle on an empty stomach, pre workout helps a lot. I think it'll be good at least in the beginning

Any help appreciated.

238,Reflections 2 months into IF,"38F // SW: 160 CW: 148 GW: 140 
Currently doing 17:7 with weekly OMAD 

Lost 5lb this month compared to 7lb last month.

-maintained a relatively small daily caloric deficit (eating 1500-1700/day)
-incorporated (20-40 minute) daily HIIT workouts, presumably building some muscle, and felt hungrier.
-consumed substantially more alcohol this month due to socializing; however IF is still valuable in eliminating nighttime drinking. 

Some new habits/ struggles:

-my first 24 and 48hr fasts! I had been doing OMAD 1x/week for 6 weeks, so 24hr was a cinch. I hadn‚Äôt originally planned on 48 hrs, but found myself feeling good enough after 24 hr to tack on an additional challenge. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it wasn‚Äôt as difficult as I expected, and I treated myself to a steak to break fast. 

-flexible IF schedule. It‚Äôs not possible to maintain the same daily timing over the long term, so I just readjusted the next day‚Äôs fasting window as needed. 

-my first really bad cheat day. I knew it would be a cheat day, but it began to spiral after 2-3 beers, and I ended up ordering delivery and snacking ‚Äîall between the hours of 8pm -1am. The hardest part was actually just going back to normal the next day (as opposed to going on a guilt driven long fast that would inevitably lead to another binge) 

-making home cooked food delicious in low sugar ways. This has been key to taming hunger for me. Layer food with flavor and texture. Lemon juice, hot sauce, cilantro, ginger, sesame seeds, flaxseed, coconut oil, parsley, kimchi. I typically prep a week‚Äôs worth of quinoa and bean (black, chickpeas or lentil) base, and then add roasted vegetables /protein/ egg/ avocado/ fruit/ cheese on top (~500 calories) as a go-to meal. 

-exercise-related hunger. About 2 weeks into my exercise regiment, 18:6 felt too hard, so I went back to 16:8, and built back up week by week. 

-period-related weight flux. 5-7lb swing both months. Crazy. 

I continue to experience high levels of energy and great sleep.

I had an initial drop in weight that I assume was water weight loss (5 pounds in 5 days), but since then I‚Äôve been holding steady. Is it normal to have a plateau like this? Can I expect the weight to start coming off slowly, or is this a sign that I may need to change things up?

257,New member,"Hi everyone, 

I am a 58F, 5'7 CW 217.5, SW 220, GW 150. Started on June 29 with 16:8 

I am a very busy high school principal and will be retiring after the 2021-2022 school year (I think).  I gained a lot of weight the last few years, between being a principal and trying to run a high school safely during Covid for the last year and a half, and some serious illness/injury in my immediate family, I just stopped looking after myself. This was the toughest year as a high school principal I have ever had and I could just feel the stress hormones running through my body all the time.   I'm not much of a drinker, but I did find myself snacking really late at night and also eating very badly at work- cafeteria food, sweets and snacks that people brought in, that sort of thing.  I was at 180 for a long time before that and even though I was still too heavy, I exercised a lot more, felt better and had great blood sugar and cholesterol levels.  Now, my blood sugar is too high, my cholesterol is high and I have achy knees and a back that just hurts all the time.  I feel I have aged 10 years in the last 2 due to my daughter being seriously ill in her senior year of high school (2019 )- and my husband having a terrible bike accident and breaking his neck- also in 2019. All of that life stress, plus the demands of my profession which I love has added up to a not very healthy version of my old self. This 40 pound weight gain in the last 2 years is really slowing my body down and the lack of energy is concerning.   So as a person who has tried almost every diet around in the last 25 years and failed, I feel like IF is something I can just adopt as part of my life.  I refuse to make it complicated because it won't work for me if I have to measure, count macros, and generally be super detailed about eating.  My doctor recommended it as something that has worked for some of his other patients.  

One question- I see a lot of younger people on this forum.  Have any of you who are in the 50+ age bracket had much success?  I know my metabolism has slowed with age and lack of activity.  Not sure how much that will affect my IF success, but so far I feel pretty good. The thing I notice about getting some exercise in the last week is that if I try to exercise after I eat, then I feel unwell-kind of dizzy and super tired.   I actually feel better when I'm exercising during the fasting hours.  Is that unusual?  

This seems like a really supportive group.  I'm happy I found it!",intermittentfasting,1625445518

267,"Planning to try my first 5+ day water fast on monday, any tips or advice?","Hello all.  

So, as the title says, I'm planning my first 5 day water fast on monday.  It is after the 4th of July, but I'm not doing the fast because I'll be eating well tonight.  It's just something I've been planning to do for a while.  

So, a little background: I've been doing IF for a while now and I've done extended fasting before with my longest being 72 hours.  Extended fasting went well, for the most part.  Didn't notice anything during 24 hour fasts, but started noticing some symptoms when I was doing 48+ hours because I was lacking electrolytes.  So, I ordered some (took a while to get used to) and extended fasting since then has been fine. For this I want to fast 5 full days (mon-fri fast, eat saturday).  It'll be my longest fast, but I want to build up to a 7 day fast and potentially even longer.  

Some things I'm doing to prepare: I've reduced my carb and sugar intake a lot in the past few weeks.  I'll be focusing on eating plenty of fats and protein during my meal tonight.  I'll indulge in a little carbs and desserts tonight, but nothing crazy.  I have more than enough electrolyte packets to last me the 5 days.  I have plenty of water available, but plan on picking up reusable water jug as it'll be easier to monitor how much water I'm drinking.  And I'll be relaxing most of the week.  I work from home, not a lot of traveling, not a lot of stressors.  Just going to chill, go for walks, catch up on some movies and tv shows, play some call of duty...easy stuff.  

So, that's the plan.  Any advice or things I should look out for?  Also, what are your opinions on refeeding?  Is necessary after 5 days fasted?  After 3 days, I had no issues with it but not sure about after 5 days.  I've looked online and some people say you should refeed slowly and others say it isn't necessary.  I just want to get general thoughts on it.",intermittentfasting,1625432589

271,Benefits of Clean vs ‚Äúdirty‚Äù fasting,"What are the main benefits/‚Äúpros‚Äù associated with keeping your fast as clean as possible?

I understand fasting as cleanly as possible is about not triggering an insulin response. I‚Äôve recently started doing 16:8 and I‚Äôve been the trouble I‚Äôve been having with keeping my fast as clean as possible has to do with caffeine. 

I usually lift weights for 45 min - hour every morning and I‚Äôm really used to a heavy caffeine hit before I go- I usually drink a pre workout (with zero calories - though containing artificial sweeteners) before I go. I know it‚Äôs not ‚Äúgood for me‚Äù but I‚Äôm totally addicted and I‚Äôm just wondering how much I‚Äôm hurting my fast- I really am committed to getting healthier and losing weight. 

I also supplement with apple cider vinegar in the mornings either with gummies or a liquid mix I make‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm wondering how bad that is for me to have on my fast‚Ä¶ in order not stay clean I‚Äôve been waiting the 16 hrs- eating the gummies then waiting 20 min to have my first real meal (although by this time I‚Äôve had the caffeine drink so not as clean as could be lol). 

Thought about switching to coffee cuz I feel the pre workouts are really honestly terrible- in the past I‚Äôve started my days with coffee but I‚Äôve stopped drinking it in lieu of the energy drinks. But I drink my coffee with a little milk and sugar usually so that wouldn‚Äôt be that clean at all either. 

Trying to figure out what‚Äôs going to be the most realistic/healthiest solution for me to routinely do daily for fasting. Any info from those more knowledgeable and experienced with fasting would be greatly appreciated.",intermittentfasting,1625424618

288,6 months: Confessions and progression of an IF cheater SW:210.4 CW:177.5 GW: Healthy,"I started IF on 01/01/2021. I tore my ACL and MCL back in October of 2019 just before COVID hit so I was coming off of a year of little to no activity. I also knew that I was hitting the big 5-0 in 6 months so I was determined to get into better shape before reaching the milestone.  Of course, I'd told myself the same thing before hitting the big 3-0 and 4-0 but nothing ever came of those. This time I figured I'd use IF to curtail my poor eating habits (lots of late night snacking and a nightly pint or two of craft beer) and I would alternate days of cardio and weight training.

My diet: 20:4 with only water, coffee and and green tea as beverages. Initially I told myself that I wouldn't ""diet"". I was coming in angry at myself and resentful at the idea that I had to do this strict program to get into shape. I told myself that if I was only going to eat for four hours I was gonna eat whatever the heck I wanted. Also, I wasn't sure that I'd be able to stick to this program without a cheat day. I really wanted a reward in the form of a cheat day- A light at the end of the tunnel every weekend. It wasn't long before my cheat day became cheat weekends which usually included late night snacking on Friday evenings. What's funny to me is that even though I cheated EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND, I found myself curtailing my cheating a bit because I didn't want to lose what I'd worked so hard for all weekend. I did a lot of compromising with myself on my cheat days.  (e.g. ""if I'm gonna have a couple of beers and BBQ this evening then I should probably just break my fast later in the day with a salad or a bit of cottage cheese and fresh fruit or not eat at all until it BBQ time"")

My running: I actually started walking back in mid to late 2020 as rehab for my knee. I had a 3.6 mile loop that I walked a few times a week. My goal was to eventually run that 3.6 mile loop a few times a week. My walking slowly became walk/jogs and I think it took about a month and half before I could run a full mile. Eventually I was running the whole 3.6 mile loop at about 12:00/pace. I worried a lot about what people driving past would think because I felt like was running really slow. My knee was still bothering my off and on so there were times that I just walked about as fast as I could.  At one point my knee got really sore so I took 9 days off before starting my walks again and eventually running again. I've worked up to the point now where I'm running 6 miles three times a week at just under 9:00/mile pace. I'm really proud of that. I grew up with pretty severe Asthma so I've DESPISED running for most of my life. My asthma is not nearly as bad as an adult and it seems counterintuitive to me but my Asthma is nearly non existent since I've started running regularly. I went from using a rescue inhaler on a near nightly basis to only having used it once in the past 4 months.

My workouts: I have a set of dumbbells, a junky thrift store bench in a spare room and dip/pullup station in the backyard. I didn't really start using them until around March. Up to that point I just focused on my cardio. I started really slowly because I didn't want to get really sore and have an excuse not to workout the next time. My initial weight sessions literally only lasted about 5-10 minutes. At this point I'm in the ""weightroom"" 2-4 times a week and never longer than 30 minutes.

Regrets: I don't regret all of the cheating.  Sure I could've probably lost another 5-10 pounds but I also might've quit altogether. I regret that I didn't document more.  I really wish I'd jotted down nightly notes about what my meals were, and what workouts were/how they felt. I told myself initially that I'd take daily photos. I gave up on that early on and i wish I hadn't. I don't need it. It wouldn't have changed anything really.  I just think that it would've been fun. Oh, I also regret not doing any ab work.

300,OMAD + Diarrhea causes?,"Hello everyone, I'm using a throwaway because of the embarrassing topic, so please don't use your awards on me because they would be wasted!! I had to wait to get to 10 karma to post on this sub, too, so I'm not trolling if you see my post in other subs - I just want to get as many opinions as possible and this is the one with the most members.

I'm \[26F 5'1 165lbs\] **2 months** into a mostly 23:1 IF weight loss plan where I stay on a caloric deficit and eat a low-carb, high-protein diet. When I started my BMI was 32 and my eating habits were quite bad, not American fast-food level bad but still not healthy.

I am losing weight and feeling pretty damn good overall. My energy level is higher and I'm happy with my new healthy habits

HOWEVER, I'm having a **serious problem** with diarrhea. I eat my meal at dinner and whenever I have a fully clean fasting day, I get a bad case of diarrhea 2-3 hours after eating dinner. I don't know why this happens but it's really worrying me because it doesn't look healthy.

I have no prior health issues other than being obese. I don't use artificial sweeteners, and I don't eat a lot of fats. My blood tests came out perfectly twice since I started. The fat I eat usually comes from meat cuts, or EV olive oil. I eat a Mediterranean diet. The diet is low-carb but I just exclude the ones from processed food, regular wheat and sugary food. I eat foods that naturally carry carbs like potatoes or beans, just in moderation and not every day. My meals usually are 1200 calories or lower if I didn't have a clean fast.

This started as soon as I changed my eating habits and NEVER subsided for two whole months. I make sure to rehydrate when it happens and I have no other worrying symptoms.

I would really like to know if anyone has ever had the same experience, and am especially curious to know the cause if somebody knows. Most of what I read links diarrhea to eating a lot of fat, sweeteners and coffee or having other medical issues, but that's not my case.

So I would really appreciate some insights into this issue, a lot more than advice actually, because I already promised myself I would change my diet plan to a more traditional one if this doesn't stop soon.",intermittentfasting,1625391694

312,I started the Warrior Diet/Intermittent Fasting,"So I recently started a diet. My boss told me about it and raved about how great it was. I started it with him without doing much research. I knew it was a type of fasting but didn't know there where so many different kinds. After researching it I found out it's called the ""Warrior Diet"" which is 20 hours of no eating and then 4 hours to eat whatever I'd like to. But in the article it said it's technically not traditional fasting yet other articles claim that it is. Is this a type of fasting and if anyone does this specific type I'dk like to know how has it been for you? It's been my 3rd day now and I feel pretty good. I have bursts of energy at random times I feel like and overall I feel more productive then I typically am. I've been doing it where I don't eat at all for 20 whole hours and then eat anything in my 4 hour period. The article says I should be eating non processed healthy foods but that's pretty difficult due to my schedule. My window for eating is 9:30 am to 1:30 pm. I don't think there's a specific time that's needed to eat. But if there is please tell me. I found that this time frame works best for me because it's typically when we break for lunch at work. Plus I have some time to have a few little things while I work in the morning. I hope I'm doing this right and if this isn't the place for this please let me know and I'll take it down. But also another question I had is what's the rules on drinks? I've been drinking water and hint water which has zero calories. But I'd like to know if there are any other drinks I could have? It's been getting kinda bland. I thought maybe tea with zero calorie sweeteners like splenda? Would that mess with anything? Thanks for reading all this. All comments and advice are much appreciated.

I'm a 22 male, 6'3"", and SW was 337lbs. I've dropped to 320 in two weeks and I'm so shocked by the drop this can't be right. I did 16/8 the first week because I hate breakfast, and this week I've been doing alternate day with no broken fasts. 

My calories on feasting days has hovered around 2,100 but my TDEE for cutting is 2,599. I haven't felt hungry enough to eat more those days, and only a little hungry on fasting days. 

THE QUESTION: 
Do I need to eat my TDEE / more calories?

I'm getting mixed signals of ""eat what you want"" and ""make sure to eat enough!"" What I want to eat (low carb) can't get me to my TDEE without eating past the point of being full, but I don't want to end up in a hospital.

I think my body has stabilized. I am wondering if we need fewer calories than we are made to believe. I think that our daily caloric intake causes unnecessary stress on the body.

So I decided to stop caffein, with the cold turkey method.

To regain some energy in the day, I usually took a nap of 35 minutes else I couldn‚Äôt go on the work in the afternoon.

No more rush to the toilet after the morning coffee (you know what I mean) 

I think my bowel thanks me to have stopped caffeine.

My muscles are more relaxed than before ( my chiropractor confirmed this statement at my trimestrial appointment (today) ).
When I go in bed i get in sleep more easily and quickly before. 

When I break my fast, i eat less than when I drank coffee, I can‚Äôt finish the  portion I had usually.

351,Father doing IF lifestyle with a child who has an ED.,"Greetings, 

I'm a 43 y.o. male who's 6'1"" (186 cm) and currently weighs 253 lbs (115 kg). As an adult, my weight and health has fluctuated from 320 lbs with pre-diabetes and high cholesterol and 220 lbs and daily workouts with calorie restriction. 

Every year, I experience the yoyo, and quite frankly I am tired of it. I've played around with IF before - doing carb backloading and as a diet plan, but I never embraced it as a lifestyle. Recently, I read ""Eat. Fast. Repeat."" by Gin Stevens, and it finally clicked that IF is a lifestyle, not a diet. So, I'm about 45 days into a lifestyle change. I've felt the best following an 18:6 protocol with an average of 2300 kcals consumed (I have an active lifestyle and a physically demanding job). The intuitive eating is starting to occur. 

So far, the body composition change has been great. I've maintained my body weight while my subcutaneous fat is melting away. It really it rewarding when you have to tighten your belt and can wear XL shirts. üòÄ

I can deal with coworkers asking why I don't eat on breaks anymore, and shrug off the looks and criticisms from them - they don't have power over me. The real struggle is at home. My wife can't wrap her head around delaying eating or the health benefits that seem counterintuitive to her. To further complicate doing IF at home, my oldest child is recovering from an ED. I've discussed what I'm doing with her and she sees me eating large meals during my window, but I'm concerned that it might be a trigger for her. Therefore, I tend to follow a 14:10 eating pattern on the weekends. For now, this should work out.

My main concern is when my fat loss becomes very apparent. The conversation will change to why I can lose weight and my oldest can't. Why can I get thinner while she can't. Etc. I plan to have a conversation with the my child's therapist to help guide this discussion. My health is the driving force behind this lifestyle, but how does a 14 y.o. understand that when the ED voice says it's all about looks?

I guess the main question is, I'm I being selfish and counterproductive to my child's needs by embracing an IF lifestyle?",intermittentfasting,1625331563

My starting weight when I was at the doctor was 323lbs. I knew I was fat, and had thought that I was  around 350 so (sadly) this was a pleasant surprise. 

Now, my wife has been bugging me for years to get a treadmill and I happened to find one on FB marketplace about a month ago for $250 that is originally from a gym that actually has elevation and different courses you can do so I started using it daily doing one of the courses that has a lot of elevation changes and I walk at 2.3 mph for 30-45 mins (my knees don‚Äôt like my weight so it‚Äôs the best I can do currently). 

As for meals, I‚Äôve been eating a lot of baked chicken or fish and little to no carbs. We have been trying to use MyFitnessPal as a way to track our exercise and eating habits. I have it set to lose 1lb a week so it calculated roughly 2130 calories a day. 

So far not only have I not lost weight, I‚Äôve actually gained weight since eating healthier and ‚Äúexercising‚Äù.

I plateaued at 67kg but i wanted to reach my goal weight of 60kg so I started eating only 800cal a day on OMAD. It was then at that year that my family became worried because they'd notice me always looking pale, weak, and irritable. They'd encourage me to eat because my lips would literally turn white, if that makes sense. There were also a few instances where I kept fainting even without doing anything strenuous. 

In 2019, it was then that I decided to not be strict with myself and ate what i wanted, had occasional cheat days and meals, and still intermittent fast (somedays it could be OMAD, 20-4, 16-8) that led me gaining 3 kilos (70kg). It was a noticeable change but it didnt really bother me much. (also noticed that during my meal times, i binge and eat everything)

Then the pandemic happened and quarantine has me eating more than I should.

I don't work and am off school right now while I take care of diagnosing some health issues--I may have fibromyalgia, which is one of the big reasons why I want to lose weight. So my day to day is pretty sedentary, but kind of whatever I make it, and I have no real sleep or eat schedule. Also keeping to around 1500 calories daily, though I push it to 1600 some days. 

I can feel the pounds falling off and me and my family have noticed a huge difference in my appearance, energy levels, and even in the symptoms I've been having re: fibromyalgia. I feel fucking great, frankly, and it's my newbie opinion that the irregular fasting schedule would kind of keep my body on its toes? But I could be totally off base there.

Was just wondering if anyone else does the same, and if this would lead to sustainable weight loss--not sustainable in regards to me keeping with it, but sustainable in terms of results.",intermittentfasting,1625270486

387,The very start of my weight loss journey with IF,"Hi there, I'm new to the subreddit and IF, so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong and I'll do what I can to fix it. My basic info is as follows.

Female - 5ft 1in
Starting weight - 161lb
Current weight - 159 lb
Goal weight - 110 to 115 lb

Fasting is 20:4, usually eating between 2 and 6PM. In the morning I have a cup of instant black coffee without anything added and I sip water throughout the day. I also play Beat Saber for around 2 hours, twice a week for exercise.

What I've noticed in the first week is that I lost 4lb, but then after hitting day 14, I've gone back up by 2lb.

When I search both on reddit and the general internet, I get a lot of 'common mistakes' articles, but it's all very vague about how weight coming back is because of too much or too little food intake. ....that doesn't help at all. Maybe I'm just getting over eager, and 2weeks isn't enough for stable results, but did anyone else have this experience when they first started?",intermittentfasting,1625268263

389,New to IF. Is 24 hours/week safe?,"Hello, I am 27, female and 5‚Äô3. My SW was 225 sometime around April or May. I‚Äôm currently down to 213 doing CICO and eating almost exclusively healthy vegan food(they have A LOT of junk food nowadays so vegan does not inherently mean healthy üòÖ). Anyway my goal weight is 150 and we‚Äôll go from there. 

I heard about IF in a human documentary on Netflix and learnt that the body burns fat reserves after 24 hours. I‚Äôm wondering if that is safe if I work a pretty active full time job(almost always walking and pushing big heavy carts) along with working out 3 - 5x/week. I usually do a little upper body strength training, interval training of running flat and walking hills, on the treadmill for 20 - 30 min. And a short youtube ab work out on days when I don‚Äôt get to the gym.

I want to lose a little faster, so I want to do a 24 hour fast, only a vitamin, coffee, and water once a week. Is this sustainable? Today is my first day fasting. I haven‚Äôt eaten since 1am, it‚Äôs about 6pm now and I feel ok. I brought a healthy meal in case I feel weak. I have a history of fainting due to anemia but like I said I‚Äôm taking vitamins.

I guess with a period due in 4 days, more progress was unreasonable, and it's actually a big achievement not to be raiding the cookies every half an hour!

I'm DESPERATELY hoping I am gonna get that sudden continued fat loss once my period passes that everyone here seems to enjoy! I realise other people are more dedicated than I am, and definitely more power to them, but I can't push myself too hard too soon cos I used to have an eating disorder and I have POTS so I am just delighted I am even managing IF without hurting myself! But not seeing progress can be really scary and demotivating! 

BUT losing 10lbs in 3 weeks is still not bad! Considering I wasn't strict with calorie counting and I really struggle to cut out carbs. 

I would really appreciate any motivation and reassurance cos I'm alone in doing this pretty much and I'm worried I haven't got it in me to keep this up day after day! My weight loss is crucial to improving my chronic condition but I dont get much attention from my doctors cos it's 'uncurable' and not life threatening (just the minor issue of poor quality of life!) so you're just left to manage it alone with lifestyle- so here I am trying!

397,Fasting While Working in the ER [My Experience + Tips for Success],"I thought I'd shared a few ideas I wrote about recently, about the potential benefits of fasting at work, and how to do it successfully.

I work in the emergency room as a physician assistant (PA). When I first started trying intermittent fasting, I wasn't really sure if it would be a good idea to do it at work.

Eventually though, once my body had adapted a bit to a fasting lifestyle, I found fasting at work was not only relatively easy, but also really beneficial.

For example, I found fasting at work to be convenient, since I was often too busy to find food anyway.  Similarly, it's easier to fast when I stay busy, which means fasting at work is particularly easy since the time goes by so quickly!

I also find fasting helps me focus, and once I get into a considerable state of ketosis I experienced that ""mental clarity"" that people often talk about.

Fasting at work may not be a great idea for everyone, at least not right off the bat.  But if you want to try it, here are some suggestions:

1) Start slowly, so your body has plenty of time to adapt

2) Try to boost your ketones in advance, through nutritional ketosis (or perhaps taking one of those newfangled ketone supplements ;) ) 

3) Boost your salt levels (and consider other electrolyte supplements)

I think once you get the hang of it, you'll probably find its both relatively easy and quite beneficial!

Any advice?,intermittentfasting,1625248840
405,Cardarine + 48h fast (personal experience),"Before we begin I understand that I'm likely to get some flak from both subs that I post this to, people who fast are usually quite health orientated and would condone the use of performance enhancing drugs, most of the PED community are very performance orientated and might call what I'm doing unessicary or ""bad for my gains"". Listen- I understand- my priorities are different to yours- tHiS iS fOr sCiEnce. 


So anyway, 
I'm 18y/o male, I've been fasting for 16 months (various periods of omad but mainly a 48h fast every 30 days). Although I'm performanced focused I put longevity at a close second, and as I age and get to the level of fitness I want to be at my priorities will change. I have minimal PED experience (8 weeks of 12.5mg ostarine + 10mg cardarine daily a few months ago) and  never intend to go any more potent than that to be honest. I train muay Thai and I powerlift (8 day training split: 4 large strength sessions, 2 small strength sessions and 3 muay thai sessions) when I fast I rest the day prior and during the fast i do light full body isolation work just to minimise catabolism. Now that you know my whole life story let's start on about the fast. 

I'm not incredibly metabolicly flexible and as I stated earlier my main priority at the moment is performance, so I usually spend the 28 days i dont fast eating shit loads of carbs and avoiding catabolic states. Because of this metabolic inflexibility Its safe to imagain that I get quite catabolic quite quickly during the first 18-22h of the fast, and I would like to minimise that catabolism without inhibiting autophagy. So when this fast came around I had the idea to dose some of the cardarine I had left over from my sarm cycle to exoginously enduce more ketone utilisation. 

I had my last meal at 18:00 on day 0, carried on with my life and went to bed that night, got up the next day at 06:30 and dropped 10mg under my tongue so this was roughly 12 hours fasted (I'd have liked to have waited another 2 or 3 hours but I had work so I had to do it early). At this point my glycogen would have been depleted but not exhausted, usually at hour 16-20 I'll feel mildly hypoglycemic and I can safely presume that my body is breaking down more muscle tissue than what it would should I have been more metabolicly flexible. After I dropped the cardarine I carried on with my life and completely forgot I was fasting till about 8 hours later. So at the 20 hour mark (lunch time at work) I looked back at the day and realised that I had had a completely different experience to how I usually feel during the first 10-20 hours. Normally I'll have very mild muscle soreness, ill feel slightly ""light"" or ""weak"" and this usually subsides after 20 or 22 hours fasted when I can safely presume my glycogen is close to exhaustion and my ketone production is beginning to ramp up. This day 1 was completely different, I felt great, I felt really clear, I had no hunger, I even forgot i was fasting for a while. 

After lunch break I carried on at work and started to feel the effects of fasting but predominantly just clear headedness, I was aware my stomach was empty but I wasent hungry at all. Got home went to bed and woke up the next morning and dosed another 10mg. Day two was even easier than the first but there was far less difference in the level of discomfort I had felt (usually with my current physiological state day 1 is horrible, day 2 is heaven). Carried on with my natural life for the day and ate at 18:00 again. Absolutely smashed it it was by far the easiest 48h fast I had ever done. 

Do I recommend people do this?
No. 
Why have I put it up here?
In the off chance anyone else is intrested in taking cardarine to mitigate the catabolism during the first stage of an extended fast.",intermittentfasting,1625246878

412,I'm a bit more than a week into IF - I got some questions.,"So a bit of background - I'm 24, will be 25 in January. I'm around 5'9"" currently weighing 227 pounds with a goal of getting down to 170 on a 16-8 from 10am to 6pm. I've been calorie and food tracking (with myfitnesspal) capping myself at 1,500 calories and trying to drink at least 3 liters of water everyday. I also box twice a week and I try to get out and alternate running/walking every other day.

The reason I'm making this post is because - and I don't even know if this is the right way to phrase it - I feel 'stuck'. My first few days the results were absolutely insane, losing around 500 grams a day. But the last few days I've been stalling on the scale, either losing very little or not at all. My coach also told me that the weight loss at the beginning will be rapid but slow down after a while.

So here are some things I've observed about myself and wanted to ask:

1. Some days I end up eating very little - today I only had breakfast. Is this normal? I just didn't feel hunger during my eating window.
2. Is there something with my food choice that I'm doing wrong? For one I know I'm having enough protein, but is there something I should be generally trying to cut back / focusing on?
3. Do any of you also welcome that feeling of hunger while you're fasting?

If anyone's got any general tips to fill me in on - and I'm sure I'll remember some more of my questions soon - it'd be awesome to hear. Thanks!",intermittentfasting,1625242499
413,Is there more to it than just when you eat?,"43F, Height: 4'11, SW: 140, CW: 137.4, GW: 120

Guys, I've been struggling for the last few years to lose \*any\* weight past about 3-4 lbs. I was just diagnosed prediabetic, my blood pressure is ""concerning"" and my doctor told me that if I can just get back down to my normal weight range of 120-125 (where I've mostly been for the last 20 years), I can avoid medication. But beyond that, my doctors (yes, plural, because I've been to several of them to try to figure out what's going on) don't seem to be interested in figuring out \*why\* I can't seem to lose weight, despite dieting and exercise. To say I'm frustrated is an understatement. It's more like demoralized at this point. IF is literally my last resort because everything else I've tried (keto, paleo, calorie restriction) has done jack. I walk 2 miles a day on average, and now I'm swimming laps for 30 minutes most days as well. I'm not fit, despite the exercise, but that was honestly never my goal. I just want to be \*healthy\*, but my blood work refuses to reflect any of these efforts. 

I started 16:8 IF 2 weeks ago and was encouraged by losing about 3 lbs, which was the most I'd lost in almost 2 years of this incredibly frustrating journey. Decided to give myself a small cheat day off and didn't even go crazy with the food, but I had 4 cocktails over the course of the day. Gained the 3 lbs right back and now I'm stuck again. The scale isn't moving. I even broke out the measuring tape, thinking surely that will give me some encouragement, but nope. I'm up 1/2"" on all measurements. My period was last week so I shouldn't be retaining water. The cheat day was Monday and it's now Friday, and and and... \*heaves huge sigh\* 

Did I screw myself by allowing a cheat day so early on? Is it the alcohol? I barely drink as it is these days, but I was really hoping to not have to give up alcohol completely, since craft cocktails are one of the few food-related things I really enjoy (and my boyfriend is a bartender, which makes it hard to avoid forever). 

I am so envious of people who can just shed weight. I have always had to struggle to lose anything, making drastic lifestyle changes in order to see the numbers drop. I know some of that is because I'm small and have a relatively small amount of weight to lose and that makes it harder comparatively, but ffs. It's starting to get inside my head. Every doctor's appointment where I'm scolded yet again for the shitty bloodwork numbers and threatened with medication, their clear skepticism that I am being honest about how much I eat, what I eat, and how much I exercise... And I try to advocate for myself and ask them point blank what more can I do? Could there be something else that's causing these issues? And they run a thyroid panel and everything comes back normal and that's that. Lather, rinse, repeat. I'm at my wit's end.

428,"A year on IMF- my expirience (27M, 5ft 10, SW-230lb,CW-170lb,GW-265lb","This post is mostly for me to reflect on the last year- I though I'd share it here in case it helps anyone, but I don't know if it would have a wide appeal.

I knew I'd been putting on weight in the first few months of lockdown, but stepping on scales for the first time ever on 1st July 2020 and seeing 230lbs was still sobering- I wasn't morbidly obese, but I was pretty far into the obese category. I knew something had to change, or things would get worse, and I liked how IMF sounded- it gave structure in what was a pretty chaotic time.

*The Glory Days (July to September, 16:8, OMAD three times a week). *

The first few days were hell. I went all in, ignoring all advice, and felt like I had the flu for the first few weeks. I was tired, grouchy, and unhappy. But the weight flew off. Alongside IMF, I'd planned a calorie controlled diet, which it all the major food groups but at a low calorie count- again, I loved the structure in the chaos. In these two months, I lost 30lbs- at this rate I'd be skinny by Christmas! Hitting 199 lbs felt glorious. 

*The long Haul (September to December, 16:8, OMAD three times a week).*

I didn't change anything, but the weight loss slowed. I was still losing weight quicker than the NHS recommends, but it was quite depressing to see the slowdown in my results. Looking back, this was a dangerous thought process, and could've led into a pretty unhealthy attitude to food. Luckily, I had my family to offer positive reinforcemtb, and to help me realise I was still succeeding. I lost 30 lbs in 4 months, leaving me 5lbs away from ""healthy"" 

*Christmas (December, obviously, 16:8, no more OMAD) 

I went home for Christmas which, due to lockdown ended up being a 4 month stint living with my parents. Somehow, throughout Christmas, I managed to lose the 5lbs, letting me start the new year at a healthy weight for the first time, well, probably ever. I stopped OMAD because I didn't want to freak out my parents, but kept things in check. 

*The Glory Days II (January-May, 16:8)*

My parents live in rural Wales. There are no takeaways in rural Wales. I could eat more food, have more lapses, and still do great! I started walking 10,000 steps a day in November, in February I started running and did my first 5k at the start of March, in just under half an hour. I hit my all-time low weight of 158.5lbs, and was fitter and healthier than I'd ever been. I bought medium clothes. Every comment was positive. Things were great. 

*The Slight Relapse (May-July, 16:8)*

Coming back to the Big City has caused some issues- takeaways were back, and lockdown was slowly lifinting. I could go out drinking, eat meals out, and I felt like I could do no wrong. Of course, that's not true. I stopped weighing myself, and when I, stepped back on the scales, I knew what I'd see- I'd gone back up to 170lbs. It was almost like I'd ruined the last 6 months of work. 16:8 by itself doesn't work if you don't watch what you eat. 

But I know it's not a true relapse. I'm still running 5k 3 times a week. I can make small changes, and I know the weight will go. I'm holding myself accountable by wiring this. If I'd told myself a year ago I'd be 60lbs lighter and running 3 times a week, I'd have laughed at myself-itnwouldve seemed impossible. Focusing on the 10lbs gained and ignoring the 60lbs lost is pointless. 

I need to take some credit for myself, I can't say IMF and this community is fully responsible for what I've achieved. But it's helped a hell of a lot,and I dont think I'd be where I am now without it. If you're part way through your journey, keep going, you can do it. If you're just starting out, the first fast is the hardest. After that, you just do the same thing over and over again. I don't think there's anyone who's ended their journey, as IMF seems like a lifetime commitment, but if there are, congratulations on all. You've achieved!",intermittentfasting,1625227649

Now for the issue at hand - I really want to do a 36hr fast to push it a big further, for the added benefits of longer fasts but it feels like a HUGE mental hurdle. The 24hr fasts that I did were afternoon to afternoon, so I ate in the morning of day 1 and evening of the next day. A 36hr fast obviously requires going the entire day without food which my mind just can‚Äôt seem to wrap around getting through.

I figured I'd just continue my IF except I wouldn't be cooking my meals and I'd be ok. Well, with the 3 hour time difference and traveling it messed me up a little. By day two I got back to my normal 18ish hr fasting, and for the most part, stuck to it. Somehow I still gained weight and more than I thought, mom's scale seems different from mine so instead of the 3 lb gain it was 5 lbs or maybe that was water from altitude, who knows.  Over the 2 weeks after I got home I lost the 5lbs! This last week, nothing. I haven't gained but haven't lost.  As it's end of the month I took my measurement and found that I've lost 1 inch in most areas and half inch in my arms. So this week I'm going to focus on that and not the scale! There are different ways to measure success.  In the 6, going on 7 months that I've been doing IF I have learned to be patient and kind to myself.

But when you FAST it is DIFFERENT! Drinking water is NOT just a slogan when you fast it is ESSENTIAL l!!

When you fast - you are missing ALLLL the water you usually get in food. THUS you can get SUPER dehydrated SUPER fast. Your water consumption MUST change for IF to work.

Background: I've been doing this for a couple weeks, I have prior experience in Keto and there is some overlap because I guess my body will be in ketosis after some 16h of not eating and also doing physical work. Keto was not like this, I had more energy.

Now for my related question: I found it way easier to beat the hunger when the last meal consists of high fat and protein. I go for something that has about 40g each, and maybe 10 to 40g carbs as well. This will keep me from getting hungry. I know about the importance of protein but without the fat I will still get hungry soon. So, is this of any disadvantage? I have looked quite a lot in this sub, but never seen any question like this.

The problem is that I've been consistently losing an average of 150-200g a day (average!) but for around a week a month, not only I don't lose any weight, but I gain it back a bit. 

This has been a constant on the last two months, there's a specific week I don't lose weight (between the 3rd and 4th week of the month, to be completely specific).

What do I do? I was thinking on doing an off fast day to reset my body but I fear part of my progress will be erased and it's very discouraging.

Water is not the issue, I'm drinking an absolute minimum of 1.5lt, average 2.0lt a day.",intermittentfasting,1614755380

I had my usual annual check up early this year and it turns out that I kind of have damaged my liver. The doctor asked me to take some meds and have even suggested for me to do intermittent fasting. When I googled it I didn't realize I was already doing it back then. Anyway, since I need to take some meds twice a day, can I drink those meds while I'm fasting?

I started out with regular exercise, counting calories, and eating healthy foods, but saw no results. Then I found IF! As soon as I started 16:8 IF combined with regular exercise, the pounds just fell right off. I lost 50 lbs in about 8 months. I was looking and feeling amazing!

Fast forward to August 2018. I entered a healthy, happy relationship that kinda de-railed my goals. I gained 15 lbs back of the 50 I had lost by January 2019. Ive been kinda stuck between ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still healthy so who cares‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate myself I look disgusting‚Äù ever since then. I kept losing and re-gaining the same like, 8 lbs because I wasn‚Äôt serious about getting ‚Äúskinny‚Äù again.. until about two months ago. 

Due to an upcoming vacation, I told myself I was tired of hating my reflection in the mirror. I started working out at least 3x weekly (HIIT Cardio and strength training) and re-started IF 16:8. I downloaded an app to help track my fasting more accurately, and the app recommended I try 18:6 instead. I eat between 600-900 calories daily. mostly lean protein and vegetables, very low carbs. (If I eat more than 900 cals a day, I end up gaining weight.)What worked for my same body 3 years ago is absolutely not working for me now.

My main concern was I had developed diabetes and was told I would be on medication for life as I consistently had a reading of 12-18mmols of blood glucose.  


Keto worked out perfectly to control glucose levels and I am now around 5-6mmols daily even after meals, so not only do I no longer require medication but also do not experience insulin spikes.  


1500 Calories was challenging at the start, I would normally eat around 3000 calories a day and man the ghrelin kicked in HARD. After the first 2 weeks it was like nothing.  


Coupled CICO with a workout regime consisting of cardio - light cycling on stationary bike for 1 hour 5 times a week maintaining 120BPM, and resistance - Push, Pull, Legs split until failure. My resting heart rate, breathing, strength and overall fitness has improved so dramatically it's life changing.

I'm wondering if drinking applesauce is okay or if there's a better food high in fiber. The key is it being really gentle on my stomach since diarrhea seems to be the outcome with anything else. The applesauce I drink is unsweetened (no added sugar aside from what's already in an apple). I guess a juicer would work, but I'm trying to keep costs down.

I have been trying my best to not get down on myself and tell myself that it's been a month so be happy with the progress. I feel so much better mentally and I feel in control of my diet. I have had a couple of days where I slipped but the following day was a new day. I joined a local planet Fitness and have been walking with a 3.5 incline. My body took a beating while in the Navy and it's been hard for me to accept that I can't do all the crazy workouts I once was able to. Depression and anxiety have been a challenge for me and I think with intermittent fasting, I have been able to find a healthy way of being in charge of my life.

628,Calories and IF,"Hi all, I'm new to IF. On my second week of 16:8 at the moment. I'd be interested in hearing about what sort of calorie restriction you all are doing with your IF please. So I have been a forever yo-yo dieter. I was only couple of kg overweight when I started weight loss just before last Christmas but I want to get to the weight where I feel great at. I restricted my calories incrementally and I had to go as low as 1000kcal/day until it started shifting. I'm 172cm female and starting weight was 76.5 kg. The weight loss had been incredibly slow and I felt like 1000kcal just isn't enough for me. So I read about the benefits of IF on insulin levels and realised that even tho I was eating a small amount, I was doing it very often. Snacks and tiny meals. I decided to try lifting my calories up to 1300/day on my first 16:8 IF week and the weight started to go down. Just wanted to hear from others on how this has gone for you. I've found 16:8 pretty easy, much better than expected. I've been brought up on the low blood sugar and frequent snacking propaganda so I was highly sceptical.

I have struggled with long term efforts to lose weight and often sabotage myself. I‚Äôve just realized why the daily weighing hurt my efforts. 

When I weighed daily, I‚Äôd use that number to determine whether I could indulge more or needed to be more strict. If I was more strict and the number didn‚Äôt go down the next day I‚Äôd get annoyed and sometimes obsess about it. Sometimes I‚Äôd go off track thinking ‚ÄòIt doesn‚Äôt matter anyway‚Äô

I forced myself to stop the daily weigh in. It was hard. At first I‚Äôd chug the water by my bed before getting out of bed so I wouldn‚Äôt be tempted to weigh in (because I won‚Äôt hop on the scale once I‚Äôve added food/drink)

Why does it work for me? I think it works because I focus every day on my progress. I know each meal counts and it will all add up on weigh in day. I don‚Äôt obsess about it at all and see more obvious signs of weight loss more easily, like looser pants.

710,"F/28 5'3 [SW: 309.8 CW: 304.6 GW: 160] 16:8 for about a month, now I feel like I'm struggling a bit","
I started fasting January 17th, stuck with 16:8 until 3 days ago. I even gave up soda, I had been drinking 2 sometimes 3 Dr. Peppers per day, but it's now been 37 days since I've had a soda! 

I was doing pretty good, definitely had a few fuck ups but I did something different this time that I've never done with a ""diet"" before; I didn't give up. Even when I fell off the wagon, I just got back on the next day. After a few weeks, it seems like it might finally be sticking! Except now I'm being discouraged by the numbers on the scale. 

I was trying to stick to weighing myself every Tuesday but I got discouraged and now I'm letting myself be kind of ruled by it. This last Tuesday was the first one I've had where I GAINED back a couple pounds. I was so discouraged, but decided to change up my regimen. I was trying to do 16:8 everyday but for 2 weeks I gave myself ""cheat day Saturdays,"" so I figured the cheat days were probably contributing quite a bit to that weight gain and decided no more of those. But just to be safe, and since it was probably time anyway, I decided to up my fasting time to 20:4. It's not been hard in terms of being hungry, really. It's more like being bored and I love to cook and eat so it was something to look forward to during the day. I guess I need some more hobbies lol 

Well so after that disappointing Tuesday, I did a 20:4 and I worked really hard (clearing up large limb debris in the yard after an ice storm) so I let myself pig out a bit. Yesterday I decided to weigh myself and was surprised to see I lost 3.2lbs in a single day...weird. It's that time of month too so it could have something to do with bloating? 

Then last night I had a weird night and ended up not getting a chance to eat until 8pm. We had to get take out, too, so I'm sure it was a lot of calories. I had fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a roll. 

So technically I did OMAD last night since that's all I had, right? Which was nice because I was hoping to add OMAD to my regimen as well but not trying to force it too much at first. I'm taking this whole thing pretty slow so I don't give up out of frustration. I'm prone to doing that anytime I try to diet again. Especially regarding calorie counting. I am dreading doing that, I really hate calorie counting, though I realize I will probably have to do it eventually. 

Anyway, I couldn't help myself today and decided to weigh myself. Ughhh...gained back another 2lbs. Is it because I had a large dinner late at night? I didn't get to start fasting until almost 9pm last night. 

Also I've replaced my soda addiction with two low calorie drinks; one is diet lipton green tea which is sweetened with aspartame but has like 5 calories per bottle. Another is this market fresh sparkling water from Target. They are sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) and are 5 calories for an entire 1 liter bottle (which I can only drink like 1/3 of at a time). However, after reading through a few different articles, I'm worried that these drinks may actually be detrimental to fasting. The Zero app has an article that goes over all the artificial sweeteners and both aspartame and sucralose are said to be able to break a fast. Then there are studies which show that even TASTING something sweet can trigger an insulin response. I think I remember that it's especially bad for someone who is already overweight. 

Suffice to say, I'm kind of discouraged today. I was trying not to become obsessed with the scale but I started feeling like it was a rubric to measure whether I was on the right track or not. If I'm losing, I must be doing something right, yeah? Maybe not, I don't know. Any advice or encouragement is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I realized that it looks like I've only lost about 5lbs after a month of IF which isn't exactly where I hoped to be. But I just remembered that I didn't weigh myself before starting, I actually didn't start weighing myself until over a week into IF on Jan. 26th. So I have no idea how much I weighed initially. I hadn't weighed myself in a couple months before all this and my weight does fluctuate, but at my heaviest, months ago, I was about 315. Just something I was thinking about.

733,No matter where you are in your progress right now...,"Before we ever began this journey, we saw ourselves getting bigger. We knew we needed to do something about it. Many of us felt hopeless, had failed many times over at both traditional and non-traditional types of dieting. We stumbled across IF, many of us in this sub right here, and despite the success stories, we felt intimidated because it flew in the face of everything we were taught. But we made a decision to try, and that was the first step. Some of us started gingerly, some of us dove in head first. And then we started seeing and feeling results. Almost unbelievable results. Our clothes started getting too big, people started noticing. We felt uncomfortable with the compliments, because we couldn‚Äôt see it in the mirror yet.  But we saw it on the scale, and we saw our clothes get looser and looser. Some of us are just starting out, some of us are in-progress, and many of us blew past our goal weight and are still trying to pick our jaws up off the floor. 

The entire purpose of this is: remember to take a moment when you‚Äôre looking in the mirror and congratulate yourself, no matter where you are on your journey. Look yourself in the eyes and say, ‚ÄúYou did it. You took this on and you did it and look at yourself.‚Äù Give yourself a hug, a high-five, a smile, because you took that step, and you did it- you took control back over your life and your health.

I am currently a 34 year old 6' 2"" 300lb man.  I would like to be a 35 year old 6' 2"" 210lb man by February 2022.  

Dieting sucks for me as I am a very picky eater and my greens are my hardest part.  I love red meat, turkey, and chicken.  I can't bring myself to eat anything that swims.  What way do you make greens more enticing without making them unhealthy.

IF has recently caught my attention recently because I find myself not eating a lot on my days off or when I am on night shift. Which brings me to my other hurdle.  Finding a 16:8 window that works no matter what shift I'm on or do I flip my fast when I flip my schedule.  Any 12 hour rotating fasters hear have any input?

The other reason is my wife came across a fundraiser for running 100 miles in the month of September (5k a day).  Should I accommodate a diet for this and should I run after or during my fast?

781,I don't know whether I'm too tough on myself or not tough enough,"Hi,

32-year old woman here with around 30kg / 66 lbs to lose, but only focusing on the first 10% to start.

I've started intermittent fasting 11 days ago. My relationship with food is complicated, and I guess it is for many people - I definitely use it as an emotional crutch. But I also honestly love to eat, cook and bake, it's my greatest pleasure and passion in life. 

What helps me during intermittent fasting is the fact that it's crystal clear when I can and cannot eat. Once I start it's sometimes hard to stop, so eliminating that process all together feels freeing in a way.

The first week I felt like things were going great, everything (or most things) I ate during my eating window were healthy, filling, and contained loads of fruits and vegetables.

This week, not so much... I've also struggled with a couple of mini binging sessions the past few days, keeping eating when I know I'm not hungry at all, that I'm very full, and feeling guilty while I'm doing it. Like eating a whole bag of chips doesn't count when you're doing it a handful at a time.

Probably like many other people again, I struggle with an all or nothing mentality when it comes to things like this. ""Oh, I had an off day, might as well throw in the towel and go back to my old ways."" I've been through enough therapy the past few years to know that this isn't helpful behaviour and to be kinder to myself, but it's a struggle. At least I've stuck to my eating windows through this. And tbh, the crap I ate was still nothing compared to what I would otherwise eat in one sitting.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking, but I'm also done with keeping all these conflictikg feelings to myself, because shame around what I'm eating has always only exacerbated the situation. Will I automatically start eating healthier? Any advice for being kinder to myself? How can I reach out for help? (I don't feel like I have many real life friends who could relate). How can I stop doing this to myself? Does it get easier?",intermittentfasting,1630748105

However, I can't seem to go past around 14% by bioimpedance which matches what I see in the mirror.

I have no idea how some guys have such lean physiques. At the pool I go to I often see teenagers with what looks like 10% body fat. Sharply defined abs. I sure as fuck didn't look like that when I was a teen. I don't look like that now. I don't know that they're doing anything different with their diets and exercise routines.

Every day I work out at least 30-40 minutes at the end of my fast. If I work out more I feel like I'm constantly on edge of injury.  I eat healthy foods mostly like chick peas, whey shakes, veggie shakes, chicken, and a small amount of ""light junk"" like dark chocolate covered almonds of dried figs. 

I have tried increasing my diet to gain muscle but usually just get fat. I've tried cutting my diet to cut body fat but ended up the same body fat % just smaller (ie. lost muscle and fat).

815,"After learning the hard way, I‚Äôm here to remind you about the word intermittent.","I‚Äôve been dedicated to my well-being that stems from nutrition, since a year ago. 
The results are astonishing. Not only physically, but mental clarity, sharpness, agility in every day tasks, and patience.

My constitution is skinny type. But that didn‚Äôt stop me from binge eating, drinking 3 beers a day, not exercising, eating too much sugar, not enough veggies, etc. For more than 4 years. I was in terrible physical shape as well as sad mentally. Although I was still skinny for most mexicans (the ‚Äùnormal‚Äù weight here is heavily distortioned), I felt weak, unstable, and unwilling to just go with my everyday life tasks. Just bitter overall.  

Due to discipline and seeing results, I went down 8 kilos. I fasted daily 16/8 for almost a year. I am now embracing my skinny type constitution, and making best use of it (was never the strong guy,but more fast and agile). I don‚Äôt run as much as before, but I finally discovered that I can pick up my pace and stamina like it was nothing, even after not running for 2 weeks straight! All due to nutrition. Being vigilant of what I eat, not much calorie counting.  ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when I truly learned, that physical shape for athleticism‚Äôs is more than 60% nutrition. (I don‚Äôt know the real number.)

My point is howeverrr‚Ä¶.its pretty easy to go overboard. In my case, for a skinny guy, to be in the underweight limits. Since I‚Äôm at almost 34 years old, I have to be conscious that muscle mass Is  starting to decline. And I don‚Äôt do weight training. Lol

Having said this, for us skinny constitutions, be aware that constant everyday fasting can be too much. Don‚Äôt get over excited and remember the key word intermittent! 

I understand every day fasting does wonders for overweight people, but every case s different.  

For me fasting really helped me to appreciate food and it‚Äôs role for survival. 
Food tastes better after a long fast!
 the quality of food you choose MATTERs more after a long fast (aka don‚Äôt break the fast with a bag of chips, it will fuck you up.

* Breaking to do breakfast or late night drinking when traveling (which right now is roughly a few days per month)

848,MY ( my alone ) key to IF,"I've been the fat boy all my life, but in the recent 4 months I've lost 40 pounds through MY ( my alone ) interpretation of IF. I lost another pound today I think, but I ate a Snickers, drank 2x Rockstar, had some Lemon bars, and some other wholesome food. My key to IF is that I don't eat a lot at one time, but I don't hold back with liquids (Rockstars, Screwdrivers, Vodka/Cran, etc.) . I enjoy the snickers, but 2 small bites at a time, and it lasts me 6 hours. I enjoyed my fried cheese sticks, but I only ate a couple of them. When I woke up this morning I waited 3 hours before I ate a solid, but I drank several coffees with Sugar. My key to IF is to let myself be hungry enough for my stomach to rumble for 1 hour, then I eat a solid food, but not too much. 

I'm really floored by the fact that I never understood that it was OK to be hungry. I always just crammed food into my mouth all day. I think that this is the problem with the US/European weight pandemic. Yes, I said weight pandemic, exactly what it is........... Thanks Unileaver, Nestle, etc. and the quarterly profit driven economies.

I've got 35 lbs to go, and I'm going to make it. My doctor is super surprised that I dropped the weight, and have cut my BP medication intake by 66%. My average BP since starting IF is 130/85 or so. Prior to IF I was averaging 145/85. I hope to be off medications for BP after the next 35 lbs is gone.

If you need to talk, please don't hesitate to DM, it would be my honor to help someone lose the weight also. It's impossible not to notice the loss at this point, I feel like I've finally got my overeating disorder under control.

As a society we have enough food, so we talk about anorexia as a disorder. Maybe it's time to start looking at overeating as a disorder on the opposite side of the spectrum.

&gt; Should you feel unwell for any reason, stop your fast immediately and see your doctor. In particular, persistent nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, high or low blood sugar, and lethargy are not normal with intermittent or continuous fasting and should raise a red flag.

Well, for me a regular OMAD diet caused exactly the aforementioned symptoms.

Unfortunately my physician will not discuss the topic of fasting with me at all. He is adamant that all IF protocols are fad diets and tells me to just walk more and eat six times a day. He did check my blood work and aside from high cholesterol everything else was within normal range.

Also unfortunately Dr. Fung does not go into detail as to what these symptoms mean, even though he is clearly aware of their existence, and what should be done to get past them (if it is possible). 

In his books it is said that the body should be able to keep its electrolytes in check even without supplements. I wonder if there is a medical/reversible reason why this doesn't work for all people?

OK, I'm not exactly unhappy with my weight just now. But I've lost boobs and butt yet my tummy is being stubborn. (A lot of that loss was down to grief and simply not being hungry- not eating).

I picked IF for several reasons partly to fix my ""not being hungry"" (SUCCESSü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and a lot of it to do with my natural eating habits (never used to want to eat breakfast), but also because of the sugar/insulin cycle (my late husband had pancreatic cancer and was insulin dependant - not your average reason for being diabetic, but also not something I ever want to deal with myself).

So, right now I manage to fast anywhere between 12-14h. I work some strange hours, so I get home between 9 &amp; 10pm, eat something, have a hot chocolate, then begin fasting - which often is between 11 and 12. Though if I manage 10, I go with it.

 I sleep and wake up hungry around 8am. I stick with fasting, but by the time noon rolls around, I really, really just want to eat. And if I wait til 3/4pm, when the 16h window would be up, I won't get to eat because I am at work.

Any practical advice on how to shift things around? I guess, ideally, I ought to be running at the end of the fasting window, but then I'd be sleeping through the eating one.

First off, I read this sub near daily. All y'all have helped me tremendously. I haven't been under 300lbs since I went over 300 in 8/9th grade. So my current fitness level is basically uncharted waters to me. I'm still round, but the circle is sooo much smaller. 

I've lost about 60lbs over the last 9-10 months, and have been generally noticing basic movements and getting around is easier. Climbing stairs, my very physical job, etc.

Today I went on a 5 mile hike in the hills, and with the hurricane remnants everything was muddy, slick, creeks were deep, etc. Sections of the trail were underwater.  I have always loved hiking but always had issues and a lot of anxiety around steep and/or slippery bits, creek crossing, climbing big hills, etc. This is the first hike I've been on in a while, and everything was so much easier than I remember. There were tricky sections, but I wasn't spending time figuring out how to maneuver obstacles without busting my rear.

Going up hill I automatically let up about where I would have to stop and catch my breath, but nope, I realized I could just keep going. Climbing whole hills without stopping. wow.

I'm 22, 5'11 268, my GW is 180, I'm gonna be doing a OMAD type of deal. I have a few questions tho.
What are some of your suggestions for the meals I should be eating? A friend will be helping me by meal prepping for me so anything that is easy to heat up / eat cold is a plus. I tend to eat a shit ton when I'm bored / depressed / want to feel happy. Even when the food doesn't taste good I just be eating. What are some ways I could distract myself from bassically eating when I'm bored? I typically work 5 days a week, Monday overnight (sometimes 6pm-6am), Wed-thur from 2pm-2am (sometimes from 2pm-10pm), weekends from 6am-6pm. I'm not the biggest fan of greens, but I am trying to include them into my diet. If I like a meal I could typically eat it day in day out, something like chicken and rice is an example. Also, is there a way to wing myself off soda? I try so hard too do it, I go cold turkey and don't drink soda for a few weeks, but then I get a taste of soda, or think about it for too long and have a can and then just spiral and can't stop drinking soda. I would also like to start going to the gym, but I dont really know where to start, I'm big but I'm also fairly strong, I wrestle a lot with my roomate and am the guy people come to for heavy lifting. I live in Arizona so walking outside is a death wish (to me atleast) and I feel like shit most days so I just stick to playing games.
Consistentsy is key, but its really hard sometimes, and tips on how to stay Consistent too?

So far it‚Äôs great, especially for a person who forgets to eat sometimes. Having a fixed time makes me pick foods that are the most filling and most healthy. Since this started it‚Äôs been easier to not crave junk. My water intake is already up significantly! Unfortunately working out yesterday was tough.

Before fasting I could do 75 minutes at the gym, but yesterday 30 minutes was pure torture! It wasn‚Äôt dizziness, just zapped energy and exhaustion. In the past, missing a meal before working out meant working like a horse to actually finish, so going for hours without eating first was like a nightmare. Thing is, I want to fast daily and not break my streak. 

My fast starts at 8:00 pm and ends at 12:00 pm, the 16:8 fast. I‚Äôm at the gym at around 10:00 am or 11:00 am (or early. It‚Äôs the only time I can). I‚Äôm on a bit of a calorie deficit right now. I‚Äôm trying to get 1200 but unfortunately I end up getting in less (950-980s). Trying to get more protein and less carbs in, but the only proteins I can eat are sea creatures and eggs.

# 06:30

* wake up
* drink psyllium husk with water
* go to work

# 15:30 - 17:30

* return home
* eat one good meal (not overeat), mostly low carb (around 100mg of carbs)
* drink psyllium husk with water
* take 300mg berberine before and after the meal (total 600mg)
* take one fish oil pill
* eat two prunes

# 22:00

* go to bed
* maybe drink psyllium husk with water

# I burp an abnormal amount of air between waking up and having my first meal. How to fix that?

I used to have stomach burning sensation, but psyllium husk has made that disappear almost completely.

I used to have lifelong inability to burp because of R-CPD (look at r/noburp), and have heard that people who have treated it (like I have done) burp abnormally a lot afterwards.

I have been checking blood sugar levels a lot because I'm trying to reverse my diabetes. When I started my fasting blood sugar was 200, now my blood sugar has been in the 80's - 120's. It's amazing how quickly my numbers have improved, but I feel miserable. I feel sick every time I eat. I never felt sick like this when my sugar levels were high and I'm trying to tell myself it'll be worth it when I've reversed this disease. I'm just seeking some advice here, should I switch to 24 hour fasts instead? Is it miserable because I've just started? When I say miserable I mean headaches on my fasting days (which I expected) but diarrhea on the days I eat and today I even had nausea. I'm eating no sugar, I'm making sure to get protein, sodium, potassium, and I'm taking vitamins when I eat. How long can this horrible feeling last?

988,Details cuz I‚Äôm braver now,"And three weeks later,‚Ä¶ -40 lbs. OMG this is real! I‚Äôm crying! And braver,‚Ä¶ My start was 355 Yesterday at cardio rehab, weighed in at 314! Even the hospital rehab staff is impressed. I‚Äôm 67 and have hated my fatness for 55 years of that. It started around 5-7th grade. Don‚Äôt remember exactly. Being fat has been the only feature I can describe myself as. All else has never mattered. It has made me suicidal. It has made me a 67 year old virgin. It has made me the loneliest person on earth.

Maybe now I can be like any other woman. I bought a dress OFF THE RACK last week!

My goal is size 10-12,‚Ä¶ about 140-160. Long way to go. But sisyphus‚Äô uphill is flattening out some.

Finally. Wish me luck. And good coffee.

My daily caloric varies 500-1200/day. I do part the moment fasting ends and then just before it starts again. Fast is overnight. I can even ‚Äúwaste‚Äù like 200-300 calories of sweet or salty something once or twice a week to keep the MunchieBeast controllable.

I am working out M, W, F afternoons. Bike or indoor mounted bike, 45 minutes, resistance/ output intervals ever 3-6 minutes. (Cardio rehab dept. supervised) Trying to increase output efforts each week.

In terms of cardio, my ability to do certain things (I use as personal markers) my change has been significantly lessened out of breath, less pain on movement, less dependence on my cane for resist-pain stability, andvthe shocker it shockers,‚Ä¶ I miss it if I miss a workout AND actually feel good when done each workout day. My recovery time at end of the workout has gone from a couple of hours down to like 10 minutes and I‚Äôm breathing heavy for only like 1-3 min of that.

991,Not sure what changed and what I should change,"At the beginning of this year I finally worked out a very clean diet. I have since continued weighing and recording my food. It has gone very, very well. We began to have out of state weddings and things to attend and then I started to have week long work trips. Things still went quite well. I have almost zero option in where to eat when I am out of town but I have been easily able to drop 5pounds in a couple weeks and then maintain that for 4-5 weeks and then do it again. I was very happy with how this has been going. So, the last three months have had some sort of travel every couple of weeks. I don't go crazy but I don't worry a lot about what I pick to eat when out. I take a reasonable, balanced approach. But, now something has changed. I have been doing 16:8 with about three  OMAD days a week for several months, this is when I am at home.  When I come back into town, I usually start with an OMAD day, I prefer these days and usually find them very easy.  
Some days though I am suddenly finding myself so hungry around 10am. So, I will just grab some cheese or eggs. By early after noon I am just thinking about any and every kind of food. By then, I don't have time to deal with food, so I snack on nuts or something quick during meetings. Very recently, on the days I am eating during the day, planned lunch or not, I get so tired. I am just done by 3pm and could go to bed. At the same time I am craving cakes and cookies etc. Cravings have not been an issue for months. Same feeling after dinner. I am really having a hard time with how eating is making me so tired and it is making my life difficult. Typical meals are steak or chicken, broccoli or green beans and frozen berries blended in water. I haven't changed my exercise level in about five weeks and I have been maintaining this particular weight for about three weeks.  I noticed this fatigue after eating starting sometime last week. I finished the rest of the week on OMAD to avoid losing my afternoon to this fatigue but this week I keep being hit with the hungries. Since I rarely get like that anymore, I figured the best bet was to believe my body was saying it needed food. I am still keeping up my water and salt with no issue. What is it I am missing? I thought after all these months I had worked out a life change I felt great with and blended so easily in my life but something is not working well now and I can't see what I am doing any different.

993,artificial sweeteners - what is the verdict?,"I just finished reading the Obesity Code by Dr. Fung.  I was surprised that he said artificial sweeteners trigger an insulin response in your body.

What's the verdict?  I'm trying an experiment for the next few weeks and am going to eliminate sweeteners.  My main source is diet soda (diet Mt. Dew and Coke Zero are the ones I like).  I drink coffee in the morning and am now drinking unsweetened ice tea during my eating window (added lemon to the pitcher).

I've been doing IF now for about 3-4 weeks.  Prior to that, I started eating keto (3 meals a day, no snacks but did drink several cans of diet soda each day) sometime in May.  My average weight loss each month has been 6 lbs which I'm happy with.

1018,"Blood glucose levels, GI food, &amp; Weight loss","I'm fairly new to the fasting game (2 months) and totally new to the blood sugar game.

I eat over a 2 to 4 hours window from about 4 or 5pm. 
Today I tested my blood glucose levels (BGLs) using a home finger prick test. 

- 10am (13 hrs fasted) it was 5.8mmol (104mg)
- 3pm after a run it was 5.4mmol (98mg)
- 3:15pm after a tea with oat milk it was  4.8mmol (86mg)
- 6.30pm an hour after dinner and dessert or was 6.3mmol (114mg)

SO my questions....
1. My fasted BGLs are high. I understand that the body may be releasing glucose from the liver to use (for what I don't know. I wasn't being active). Is this normal? AmI prediabetic? Will I continue to lose weight with high fasted BGLs?

2. I also understand that, even when eating carbs, that glycogen stores can be depleted after intermittent fasting for a while. Has anyone gone into ketosis this way while NOT on keto? How long did it take you? 
(Yes I get that eating replenishes the glycogen stores but not always to maximum capacity).

3. How long after you eat should you measure BGLs? 5min? 30min? 1hr? 

4. Will cutting down on foods with a high GI index decease my fasting BGLs?

* restricting eating to an 8 hour window (sometimes I'll do six, and if I'm not so good I'll do 10)
* occasionally having a small snack outside that window (e.g. two cookies)
* I've really cut down on the amount of alcohol I drink, and I'll not eat in the middle of the night because I'm drunk and out with friends. And if I do, it'll be maybe 8-6 hours after my last meal, leaving a considerable gap where my body is, I dunno, nomming on itself or whatever.
* not eating so much bread and leaning more into proteins. I'll eat rice though.
* I've also really cut down on snacking on sweets throughout the day. So instead of eating a bunch of cookies throughout the day, I'll sit down and eat only three and then lay off any other sweets for the rest of the day.

A little background on me: my husband (24M) introduced me to fasting as a way to change how we view food. We both used to work intensive jobs with long hours and would have no energy to cook. The amount of our paychecks that would go to Doordash is embarrassing (we used to joke we should owe stock) and if not that then we would eat microwave meals. We did keto last year early into the pandemic when we had to work less and I lost a good amount of weight but life happened and when I went back to work full time again I gained it all back. Now he's a coding at home and I work a MUCH more relaxing job with shorter hours. We realized this is an optimal time to adjust our eating habits. He's doing 20:4 (4pm to 8pm) as he would already not typically eat until evening time. I'm doing 16:8 (noon to 8pm) as I as much more used to eating 3 meals a day. Took a few days but I'm doing great now! IF in combo with no fast food and actually cooking meals with nutrients has both of us feeling great. My husband suggested for me to try 20:4 which I didn't think I would have the discipline for. The last 2 days I ended up doing 20:4 just do to the fact I didn't end up eating until 4pm.

When starting, I did read that some people have had hair loss so when it started in mid September I wasn‚Äôt too concerned. I did have labs drawn in October and my vitamin D was low (D is a fat-soluble vitamin so possibly D stored in fat was lost along with the lost fat) and also my TSH was high (other thyroid hormones normal). The last time I had my vitamin D checked (pre-IF about a year ago) it was good so I do think it is possibly a consequence of the IF. And the reason for the hair loss. Those are theories, I am not a doctor.   


I did have hyperthyroidism about 15 years ago that was resolved with medicine, but my thyroid was normal at all checks since (except for the post-IF blood draw).   


I do have vitamin d in my diet normally but was told to take vitamin D supplements which hopefully will help. It has been about a week but it does finally look like the daily hair loss is less (thankfully, because I like my body with IF but the hair loss was a downer).

1126,Responding to arguments,"As I posted not so long ago, I am new to the world of IF.  So far I have been able to recognize my ability to ween off of a 'grazing' pattern and into 16:8 pretty easily, often stretching it out into 18:6 &amp; 20:4 (with one 24+ now user my belt).

I am transitioning back into office work (as I have been working from home for the past year &amp; a 1/2) and there have been a few 'lets go get lunch' invites that I have strategically avoided because it was in the heart of my fast.

That being said, there have been 3 people that I have shared with (other than my wife) that I am fasting.  Again hitting 16:8 but shooting for more if I can make it &amp; eating healthier, too.  So almost verbatim, each of the 3 I shared with said that it is such a terrible idea, that since my body won't know where the food/energy is going to come from, it will start to store more fat to protect itself - you are starving yourself for no good reason.  

My response has been: well I am just not eating until I get hungry, and I am not really that hungry (not always true, but I don't tell them that).  Mostly just avoiding going at it with them.  I am a kinda ""you do you"" kinda guy (As Mitch Hedberg said; ""I just want to live and let live and be let lived to let live"").  

I was just wondering: how often have you heard that, &amp; what is your response (if you have one).  Again, I am not looking to enter into arguments or anything, more than anything I would want to be armed in case something does come up where I can sprinkle a little truth regarding that specific response from people.   

The simple fact is that they can't make me eat food, so in the long run it really doesn't make any difference.  I just bob and weave and go on with my plan, but curious about responses to any societal pushback you've had.",intermittentfasting,1635955421

1134,"50 M, IF and another small thing helped me - now at 169 with goal of 162","As a result of pandemic idleness and (frankly) gorging myself on my wife's delicious cooking plus all my kids' leftovers, I gained around 10 lbs over around 18 mos. I would walk by a window and see my stomach sticking out. My feet started to hurt. My shirts and pants started to get uncomfortable. Things were going in the wrong direction and I could see myself going to 190 or 200 if I did not do something.

I instituted THREE changes:

1) IF Monday through Friday, with a minimum of 16 hours, taking breaks on the weekend  
2) Got a weight bench and started lifting - light weights, low impact stuff, no goal other than building strength and dealing with some tendonitis I picked up  
3) Getting a friend to be my accountability partner - we text each other our fast length, weight, and exercise summary daily - THIS IS A HUGE MOTIVATOR

Today I weighed in at 169. IF works, into middle age. I also found that once I built the IF habit, on many weekend days I fasted without even thinking about it. The only additional changes I made mid-stream was that I quit coffee (vehicle for sugar and oat milk) in favor of tea, and I have started thinking about portions during my 8-hour eating window.

1140,IF and working out?,"I've been practicing IF for a while now, I love it because it really helps with my IBS. It also used to align with my workout schedule - I would go for a short fasted run in the morning, eat around noon or 1pm, and then go to the gym in the evening. However, now that the days are getting darker I've decided to make some pretty big changes to my workout schedule as I'm finding that I'm missing too many sessions due to it being dark and cold when I would typically go in the summer months. 

I'm planning on doing my full gym sessions mid-morning, but the only block of time that would work for me to go is before I would have my first meal of the day. I like to do cardio while fasted but for serious workouts, I feel like I should have some fuel in the tank.

Shifting my window to encompass an earlier timeframe, like eating earlier in the day and starting my fast earlier in the evening just doesn't work with my lifestyle. I live with my husband, who finishes work later and eats a later dinner. We're both relatively young, live in the city, and usually have social events in the evening that involve dinner or drinks, I definitely don't want to give that up in my prime!

How bad is it to do a full workout (weights, resistance, HIIT, cardio, etc.) while in a fasted state? I've heard a lot of mixed reviews of this over the years, some say that it's bad, other's say that it will only impact your energy output and if you can find that energy in something without calories (like coffee) then you'll be fine, and I've even heard that it just plain doesn't matter as long as you're getting the nutrients and proteins to support your physique at some point in the day.

I‚Äôm just beginning my fasting journey and I have struggled to find details on this specific question, hoping someone can help.

Is there a significant impact on results if fasting times are somewhat erratic?

I am currently doing 18:6 fasting, but on occasion there may be circumstances that mean the fast may be longer than the 18 hours (never less) or the feeding time may be cut back. 

For example, I generally try to feed between 12-12:30 and 6-6:30, but the next day my first opportunity to eat may be at 2-2:30pm so I end up fasting for 20 hours.

1163,Fasting postpartum question,"Hi guys!

Been lurking here for a bit, and now I have a question for the experts.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 38 years old, SW 167.4lb, CW 161lb. I‚Äôve lost 6.4 lbs in 15 days. I can‚Äôt believe how easy it‚Äôs been!

My question is this. I am approaching 8 weeks postpartum with my first baby. Everything I know about weight loss says it‚Äôs important to go slow and lose the weight gradually at 1-2 lb per week. I‚Äôm clearly over that, and though I‚Äôm not complaining, I don‚Äôt want to do any unnecessary damage to my body as I am healing from a c-section and pregnancy.

Also should mention I‚Äôm not breastfeeding, and did not weigh myself until 2 weeks ago (I don‚Äôt even know how much I weighed at the end of my pregnancy‚Äî I didn‚Äôt weigh myself until I felt my weight kind of plateau after having my baby, and thought I‚Äôd start IF then).

I do 16:8 most days, some days 18:6. I‚Äôm calorie counting and usually eat between 1200-1400 calories per day. I‚Äôm lightly active - either walking, 30 min of yoga, or riding my stationary bike 15-20 min to get a little sweat in.

Would love to know if this rate of weight loss is normal or if I‚Äôm starving my body and all this is going to backfire. Pre-pregnancy I‚Äôd do IF for short periods to shed 5-10 lbs and never noticed it coming off this fast. I know I have more to lose now (my pre-pregnancy weight was 135), so maybe that‚Äôs it.

A little background:  two years ago I was 200lbs. Did 16:8/18:6 with daily exercise and CICO. In about 6 months I was 160ish (spending most of my time in the 170s). No excuse, i got lazy and I stopped caring about good habits and gained 20lbs. Resting at 180. I‚Äôve decided to get back in the game.

Okay so, I was doing 16:8 for roughly two/three weeks and not seeing progress. I decided to change up my routine to 20:4 just to better fit with my school schedule. Yesterday was my first day of 20:4 and my Biosense reader tells me I‚Äôm in Ketosis only after 16 hours?  What is going on?? I don‚Äôt think my Biosense reader is broken. I just bought. 

I eat from 12-4, but at 10pm, I checked my ketones just for fun cause I was hungry, and it read that I was already in moderate Ketosis? I ate 1700 calories in my eating window.

IF:16/8(mostly 17/7 because of what time I actually eat dinner but I give myself that extra hour if I'm running late) 

Background: I'm fairly active, I work in a labor intensive automotive factory.  Before I even get out of work I'm at about 13k steps.  I can admit I over indulge in eating before I started fasting.  I'm a busy body, work, school, hobbies, 2yr old at home.  When I'm at school, it's so easy to just grab something on the way in(4pm) or on the way home(9pm) if I'm insanely hungry.  I play disc golf 3-5 times a week which adds about another 10k steps on those days.  There are a few days where I have the day off and I just focus on school and get hardly any steps in.  Fast forward to last week when my doc during my annual physical started asking me about my weight and what have I done about it.  Told him the regular ""new years resolution"" ""I was vegan for 10 months"" ""I used to gym"" nothing worked.  He went on to recommend the 16/8 IF saying ""we never used to have the easy access to food we have now, I've never seen actual medical proof that breakfast is the most important meal of the day"", long story short, he was the first doctor to actually listen to me about my weight concerns I had about myself.

I couldn't stop reading, and it's hard for my attention to be grabbed so much from reading, but this one stuck. I genuinely felt like I could do it, like it all made sense why this works and that it would actually work for me. To note, I also did read this subreddit's  ""[welcome newcommers](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/m0i2jh/welcome_newcomers_start_here_beginners_megathread/)"" pinned thread

For a little background, I tried calorie counting, and I don't want this to come across as just complaining; but it was exhausting and I found it extremely hard to stay motivated. Not only that, but I'm nearly certain that it was inaccurate every day. How do I accurately input a corner piece of bread with some egg on it? Or a spoon and a half of chipotle (flavor) chicken &amp; rice? The corporate office I work at has a dedicated kitchen &amp; cook who makes us fresh, homemade breakfast and lunch, so I literally have to guess every day. So I essentially felt like I was just wasting my time every day, counting something inaccurately. Even if it's 50 calories off a day, which it likely was minimum, that's 350/week unaccounted for

So a lot of my questions in this thread will be about the first article I linked, because pretty much everything I read there sounds very informative and accurate (I did read comments), so I just want to get some other responses and advice, along with any misconceptions that I might have

# My situation:

`Info`: 26 F | 5'3.75"" | C/SW: 185, GW: 136

`Starting IF method` \- 16:8 (1pm to 9pm)

&gt;I choose this time range because I'd rather push it a little bit later to prevent going to sleep hungry / with cravings, than being hungry before lunch

`Lifestyle info:`

&gt;**Exercise:** We do about 3 days / week for between 1-1.5 hours. We play tennis or go to the gym, and at the gym I like to do ""functional"" or ""full body"" training (so like pushups, situps, and think of anything with a rope like a rope pull)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Breakfast** I used to have just coffee, maybe actual breakfast once a week, but I can skip both easily  
&gt;  
&gt;**Lunch** on weekdays is supplied by my corporate work, we have a dedicated kitchen and cook who makes us fresh and homemade meals. Chicken, fish, salad, pasta, sandwiches, grilled veggies, soup, rice, etc. Maybe an average of like \~600 cal?. And on weekends we usually eat something quick at home, and we like to eat out once on the weekends (either lunch or dinner)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dinner** we usually go with frozen stuff at home because it's easy and there's not enough time in the day. Ravioli, pasta, caesar salad, broccoli, cheesesteak, soup, rice, tyson chicken, etc. And again, we like to eat out once on the weekends (lunch or dinner). Maybe turns out to be like 500 calories.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dessert:** I love to snack. That's partially why I think IF will help me, because of the window shrink. But I am still having dessert after dinner, just not as late  
&gt;  
&gt;**Work / activity:** I work in IT, so... you can see where this is going. I'm on my butt pretty much all day, and when we have free time (after dinner &amp; workout) you can usually find me either on the PC or watching TV. An average of probably from like 7pm - 10:30/11pm

&amp;#x200B;

# My schedule:

`Weekdays:`

&gt;Wake up - 7:45am  
&gt;  
&gt;Work - 8:30am - 5pm  
&gt;  
&gt;Lunch - 1 hour between 11am - 1pm  
&gt;  
&gt;Workout - (typically M/W/F): For about an hour at 6pm  
&gt;  
&gt;Dinner - Varies between 30m-2h, at around 7pm. Push back if no gym  
&gt;  
&gt;Dessert - Currently during 16:8, about 20-30mins after eating dinner. Munch occasionally until eating window is up

`Weekends:`

&gt;Weekends - More of our relax time. 2 adults with no kids yet, so taking advantage of our free time. We're either working on the house, going out somewhere, or on the PC/tv  
&gt;  
&gt;Breakfast - I typically skip since I wake up much later. Occasionally we'll go out to brunch  
&gt;  
&gt;Lunch - Between noon - 1pm  
&gt;  
&gt;Dinner - Between 5-7pm depending on hunger level. Occasionally if we want to eat out big like hibachi or stakehouse, we'd skip lunch and eat an early dinner at 3-4pm

&amp;#x200B;

# Now, after reading the article, I have some questions:

&gt;*Note: I understand that maybe the author can only answer some of these, but I figured I'd ask them here just in case someone can answer the question*

1. `What do you do when you're hungry?` (the urges, mostly). So far I've resorted to chewing gum (sugar free) and trying to drink water (really don't like it so it's hard). The coffee I always made was a keurig K-pod with a TBSP of creamer and a TBSP of hot chocolate, so a latte as strong as I could handle. Black coffee is still so bitter to me, so I don't know if I can like it (I know is an acquired taste). But other than that, what else can I do? Will my body adjust to the hunger within like the first week?
2. `How do I improve drinking water if I don't like it?` This is coming from someone who used to drink 2 gal of milk / week. I'm down to a half max bc of calories, but water just isn't satisfying to me. Like I only find that I want to drink water when working out or dehydrated, I never ""crave"" it for normal meals or snacks. Also, does water help reduce bloatiness?
3. `When not in a fasted state, how much does it matter what I eat, and how much?` Obviously I don't mean the extreme like eating 3k calories for a 16:8. But can I eat normally? I thought the whole point of this is to NOT have to calorie count which was so draining for me. Can I keep eating the foods I normally eat? (obviously have been trying to add more fruits, veggies, and protein where I can, but that's just a lifestyle change I've been working on). So basically is CICO still critical in my eating window? Or does it not matter too much, just don't get out of control? Could I maybe have some examples? Edit: Just read through some FAQ, and turns out it is still important. I was asking this initially because the article that got me so interested didn't mention this at all. I was using MyFitnessPal to track but it was still infuriatingly &amp; incredibly hard to be accurate.
4. `How do I handle ""off days"" for IF?` For example if I hang out with some friends and we get pizza or snack during party games, how much will it hurt me if I either A. overeat or B. eat outside my eating window? What would happen I miss a day every other week / how far back will that set me? And will it be hard to be back on schedule the next day?
5. `After reaching the GW, what happens to IF?` Is it a just a lifestyle you continue? DO I have to keep it up to not gain it back? I would hope that by then, I will ideally have less cravings &amp; not want to eat as much

&amp;#x200B;

# Now, more info about my process &amp; questions:

&gt;Currently, I'm on day 4 and new to IF, starting off with 16:8. I was a little intimidated at first, but found that it was easy since I already almost skip breakfast, go to bed at a reasonable hour, and sleep in as late as I can. (sleep 11pm, wake up 7:45am). On the weekends, I sleep \~1am and wake up \~11:30am  
&gt;  
&gt;I feel like 16:8 isn't enough for me to loose. I think I already did the hard part which is usually skip eating breakfast, and I love sleeping in whenever I can. I always had coffee in the morning, but it was easy for me to not have any. I only start to start feeling a little hungry at about 11:30-12. I don't really get hungry right before bed (11pm)  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't really know if I physically feel better. I alreaady feel fine most normal days before even doing IF, unless I eat more fatty or bloaty food than usual  
&gt;  
&gt;I love to snack after dinner - to name a few examples: hershey kisses, doritos, ice cream (only try to once or twice a week), chocolate cookies, goldfish. If you can't tell, I love milk chocolate and cheese. I think I've been better about snack portions but I really have no idea  
&gt;  
&gt;I also am using Fastic, great app. Free version, though

**6.** Now, to start getting, seeing, and feeling results, what IF method do you recommend I switch to? Or is 16:8 enough? I don't need to go overboard, but I wouldn't want it to take forever either. Is it good that 16:8 feels easy to me? Or is that kind of normal or expected? I feel like with my current situation, the fat burning process during the fast isn't effective enough. I feel like I'm still eating too much. I'm expecting someone to stay CICO is still important, which I'm dreading, because I came here hoping to escape that

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry that this was such a long ramble and probably very scatterbrained. I know there's a lot of options but I really don't know what would be good to start off trying \[next\] based on my situation. I appreciate any tips and advice you can provide!

Over the last several years, my health was on a downward spiral. Since I started IF this past summer, I feel like I have things under control.  A few months ago, I couldn't run 3 miles without doing intervals and walking. Yesterday, I knocked out 8 without any real stops.

1236,Making sure I am not sabotaging myself,"Good morning all,
I am relatively new to this program of intermittent fasting, so I want to make sure that I am not doing anything to sabotage my progress.

I'm currently on the 16:8 program of eating at noon and stopping at 8:00 PM.  I'm actually somewhat amazed that I am not ready to knaw my own shoe by noon.

While I understand that I cannot eat non-stop from noon until 8:00 PM, my understanding is that it is natural to eat more between noon and 8:00 PM on IF than I would otherwise were I not fasting. As a result I have been eating at noon, then having something to eat twice before I have dinner around 7:00 PM. I'm not talking a full course meal, or multiple candy bars. I'm talking something along the lines of a diet bar, or some fruit and cheese.  I will confess to putting sugar and cream in my coffee on the weekend but only during my eating window.

I have been on IF for two weeks with no appreciable weight loss.  I know this will take time, and I will keep going.  I just want to make sure I am not undoing my progress.

1250,I need some motivation from you guys,"So I (M, 6'7, 151KG/330lbs, 36 years old) started IF in August 2020. It was great. I tracked all my calories, worked out around 6 days a week, combination of lifting and cardio. I used Yazio for my IF diary and calorie tracking. I lost about 12kg in 2 months! I was on top of the world. I felt light in my step, could fit in old clothes, purchased a bunch of new clothes and already made plans on what I was going to do down the year when I reached my goal of 105-110KG (230 pounds). I was in such a great rhythm. Then they announced a new lockdown... The gyms closed down. The schools closed. Everything locked. It still is. 

The combination of me not having a routine anymore, the anxiety of the pandemic, the Christmas days, and just being at home made it so that I said to myself, ""don't be too hard on yourself, get that Ben &amp; Jerry's. Don't go for a run, instead order that new McDonalds burger you didn't try yet"". And now I've gained (in two months) all the weight back that I've lost. I'm exactly at the point where I was when I started. I felt so bummed out this morning. My newly purchased clothes don't fit me anymore, and I basically got nowhere the last 5 months.    


Have any of you got to this point as well? How did you cope with it? What did you do to get back in the game? I need some motivation and the sharing of experiences from you guys.

1254,Here we go again,"Intermittent fasting was awesome for me. I lost 25 pounds and was feeling better all the time. Then, I changed jobs and gained it all back.

I was working in a kitchen and now I have a desk job. So, my routine (and hours) changed. I now work midnight to 8am.

So here it is, day 1 again. Writing this is giving me the motivation. I guess the only hard part will be adjusting my eating window again. But this group has always been an encouragement and I greatly appreciate being a part of it.

I tend to eat a bigger dinner because I have time to prep it but I notice that I‚Äôm just not hungry. Yesterday, I skipped dinner completely, being nauseated by thought of eating it. The day before, instead of eating my protein / veg / salad meal, I ate soup with garlic bread because it was all I could stomach. 

Is this related to IF? Is there anything I can do to regulate my appetite or will this come as I go along?

1257,I have stuck to something for a week for the first time in nearly ten years,"It just occurred to me today I've stuck to IF 16:8 for a week, which I know isn't very long, but I haven't stuck to something for weight loss in nearly ten years. Granted, that was an eating disorder I had in my teens but there's no need to worry as I have a healthy kj/cal target to reach and have been sticking to it, as well as acknowledging and combating any of those kinds of thoughts.

Both my partner and I decided to just give it a try and it really has just stuck. Sure, I've snacked sometimes by having some dried seaweed at 3am but other than that it's been water and tea outside of my eating hours. I think it's our autism that makes this work, because it's basically just introducing a routine into our day and it sets off the happy chemicals in our brain lol.

Anyway that's all! 1 week and 1.5kg/3.5 pounds in to what will hopefully be something I stick to permanently! My SW: 111kg/244lbs and my first GW: 90kg/198lbs and we'll see where we go from there, it has really has been all because of this community :)",intermittentfasting,1641454732
1258,Reflection for those who fell off the wagon.,"I have seen a lot of posts recently, understandably, from people who gained weight over the holidays after initially losing quite a bit through IF. This spoke to me.

I lost quite a bit of weight last year doing OMAD and reached Summer 2021 the lightest I'd been in probably 20 years (since high school). Since then, I have gained just over half of it back, and most of it in the last couple of months.

Happily, I now know how to lose the weight and I feel like I am well-trained to fast, so I have got started again and I am excited about losing the weight. I will do BETTER this time!

I thought it might be useful to reflect on why it is that I, and others, gain it back after being so successful. The hope is that we can share and understand this better so we can avoid it in future.

Me? I have this weird thing where, when I start getting compliments from people about looking slimmer/healthier, and start fitting into smaller clothes, I start thinking 'job done' and I get far too complacent and confident. This leads to me having a few days off fasting... ""no worries just make it up later. you'll be fine'. then a couple of months passes and I've put on more weight, drinking/eating too much etc. ""Ah no problem, you know how to fast, you'll be good. Just avoid sugary stuff and fast a little bit"". Then I'm back on the cakes and fast food every day and I'm like ""ahhh I'll be fine, I'll just fast later"". Then I find myself not too far off where I started it all.

FINALLY I've managed to turn around the runaway train and get back on OMAD, but this mindset needs to change!

Curious to hear others' reflections on this. Maybe we can help each other to avoid complacency on this journey.",intermittentfasting,1641454663

Other than these things, i think better managing my diet (learning about macros etc) is the next thing i need to get on top of. That said, can anybody here school me about macros?

Most times I would go over 14 hrs anyway which is why I decided to increase it to 15hrs. I noticed almost an immediate difference in my energy level.

 After starting IF last summer I haven't really had energy or sleep issues but increasing it by just one hour has given me a boost I didn't know I needed. I even focus better and my ability to procrastinate has taken a big hit. If it's on the To-do list it's more than likely getting done.

CW: 164  
GW: 162

So effective is intermittent fasting that over the holidays, even with some indulgence, I managed to lose a pound. IF is so ingrained now after 5 months of practice that it just *happens.* I barely have to think about it. The only time it intrudes is when I first get hungry in the morning, and I have to consider whether to eat yet or not. I just wait until hunger is disruptive to my thoughts. At this point I don't even have to ask myself if I've made it to 16 hours. 

Holy %$#@! IF is the real deal. I heard 100 different times that once you gain weight in middle age, that's that, you're done, you'll never get back to your optimal weight from 20+ years ago. I'm here to tell you all that is not the case!",intermittentfasting,1641392306

If i eat 1500 calories in one meal at a set time (omad) do i burn more calories than doing the exact same meal over the course of the whole day?

If works for me btw because once i eat im hungry, duento insulin production. Like ive never been a breakfast person but if i eat breakfast at 9am im hungry again at 11. But if i dont i can go till much later.

At the beginning of December last year I weighed in at (at least) 402 pounds, which is where my scales tapped out, and I realised that it was time to stop making excuses for myself. I had some awful habits - eating takeaway 4-5 times a week, and eating enough often for 2 people. I would also often eat a share-size pack of crisps (potato chips) almost every night. I knew it wasn't healthy, but I always seemed to be 'doing okay' in life despite my weight. I hid a lot of these eating habits from my friends and family who were too polite to make comments about my weight. (aside from one small child who keeps calling me 'big', as kids with no filter tend to do)

I've been transitioning towards an 18/6 IF, as well as dropping a lot of the snacking/overeating habits which had become so ingrained after many years. And I've managed to drop almost 20lbs.

1356,Why am I struggling to get back into IF and what can I do about it?,"(19,M) I am an IF success story. I went from 280 to 160. But, I'm home from my first semester at college. I didn't do IF all semester and I stopped regularly running (though I did walk 25k - 30k steps a day), combine that with drinking 3 nights a week followed by eating fried foods at a late-night cafe on campus (a ritual celebrated by all party-goers) and presto I gained some weight. My waist was 32 inches at its smallest last December and it inched up to 34 over the summer but now we're sitting at 37-38 inches of blubbery fat on my frame. I don't look fat (I think), but it's disheartening to see my pants get tighter and my jawline (my crown jewel of my good looks) round out. Over break I picked up running again and, much to my surprise, I bounced back running my fastest 10k and longest continuous run in the same run after only 5 runs. ""Perfect!"" I thought to myself. But, of course, now that the seasons are changing, my ability to run outdoors is getting limited and I hate treadmills with a passion.

  We all know you can't outrun a bad diet as the saying goes so I tried to get back into IF. I had successfully done the 16:8 method in the past with no issues and figured I'd try to get readjusted before I return to school on the 10th. I am STRUGGLING! I've failed every single attempt at a fast so far. In order for this to work with my class schedule and my university dining hall's schedule, I have to do a feeding window from 1pm to 9pm. Easy enough as I did noon to 8pm before I thought. However, I find myself struggling to get to sleep at night, and eventually caving in and eating around 3am and then waking up utterly ravenous around 11am (way too late especially when I go back to classes). 

To complicate things further, I am now getting into strength training. I haven't started yet but I decided to implement a fail-safe I knew I couldn't get around: making weightlifting a class. I go to a lib arts school and PE classes are required to get a degree so it seemed perfect. I know I have the most potential to be successful now because I am young, have access to a state-of-the-art gym, and my university serves extremely healthy (and chef-made) meals all day long. I know IF promotes autophagy which is great for fat loss and muscle building but I can't seem to get back into the routine of it. I easily drink a gallon of water every day and pee clear (and often) because of it. I'm following all the tips and tricks I used to follow that made me so successful before but my body seems so stubborn now and I don't get it.

Could anyone shed some light on what I should do or why my body is being such a dick right now? This seems like the perfect time in my life to get really fit and I don't think I'll ever regret it; I just want to get back on track.",intermittentfasting,1641334599

GW: to be leaner and healthier

I stumbled upon IF last week and have been hooked on the idea since. I‚Äôm mostly trying IF for the health benefits but I‚Äôd love to finally shed this layer of fat I‚Äôve been holding onto for ages. 

I started my first 16:8 fast on Jan 1st. Despite a big sugar slip up that same evening, I‚Äôve maintained a healthy balance of food since. 

I fast normally from 6pm-12/1pm. (So more like 18:6 lol)
Trying to limit my carbs but I‚Äôm not going crazy with it. If anything I‚Äôm tracking my calories and making sure I stay under 1,200. 

I‚Äôve come to realize that my belly doesn‚Äôt hurt in the mornings like it used to being full of food which is a godsend. 

Even though my toughest time is around the 15th hour, I always seem to make it over that hump and am able to workout at the 17th/18th hour. 

Overall, it‚Äôs been pretty easy to maintain my fasting. Not sure if this has happened for anyone else?

I look forward to eating and actually take the time to plan a healthy meal instead of grabbing whatever is in front of me when I‚Äôm hungry.

  Fast forward to today and no progress pic... i just weighed myself and am up to 224.4lbs, almost half of what i had already lost! theres no doubt that a good chunk of that is water weight but regardless i still gained a heft amount.

  we are restarting this journey and i am even MORE excited than when i first started last year cause i know that IF isnt some black magic and it indeed works! putting down the IPAs and picking up the Britas!

1406,Fast 800?,"Hi everyone, 

I recently received, read and was impressed by the Michael Moseley fast 800 plan, so I did some looking around the internet and have found a fair few people who start... But never seem to post updates or anything. 

I've dabbled in IF before, mainly 16:8 but wasn't really watching what I was eating so didn't see many benefits. I generally work better with defined rules and structures so was thinking of doing 16:8 with the 800 calories as per the fast 800 plan (med style food, cutting down on sugar). It was mainly the claims of ""initial rapid fat loss"" that drew me in, because I think that will really help keep me motivated if I can see the changes.

Do any of you have any experience with fast 800? Or just general advice for me? 

For context I'm 30yo female, 165cm (5""5) and I weigh around 116kg (256lb). I have a lot of joint pain and my immune system is just crap from being overweight - it's exhausting and I'm ready to start looking after my body better.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 35year old, 5ft 10"" male, weighing in at 200-205lbs (depending on the meal I just ate).  Over the last few years I have slowed down on my excursive I was formerly an adventure athlete (triathlon, rock climbing, backpacking), these days my main source of ""exercise"" is scuba diving and I've recently become a father for the first time to a beautiful baby boy (currently 4 months old).  Recently I have noticed I am having chronic low/mid back aches and intermittent knee pains.  My goal weight would be about 175lbs, When I was training for triathlons I was working out 40-45hours a week and weighing in at 165lbs and I looked unhealthy skinny. I don't want that, I want to be a healthy weight with a strong body and mind to be able to chase my kid around and should I be lucky enough to have a second kid chase them around too. I would also like to get back into enough shape to run a few half marathons this year without knee and back pain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not too sure where to start with intermittent fasting, I know my eating windows will shrink and I shouldn't really restrict calories. Should I start out with a 12/12 schedule and work up to a 16/8 over a few weeks? My biggest guilty pleasure is the 2-4 drinks (beers or cocktails) with my wife after the baby boy is put to bed to help wind down for the night, this usually leads to evening munchies. I'm also okay with switching out beers and cocktails for a small pour of whiskey on ice or neat (I know its not perfect but its better).

Since I'm going to do a 1,000 calorie deficit per day for weight loss, this means the amount of my macronutrients should change, right? Problem is, I don't know how to calculate what the new values should be for losing weight, not maintaining.

The site list 30%/35%/35% for macronutrients. Would those percentages still be the same for losing weight, taking into account that I'm cutting out 1,000 calories per day?

The actual numbers for the macros are 294g protein, 131g fats, and 147g carbs. So, I'm assuming the percentages stay the same, but not sure how to calculate the new numbers based on the 1,000 calorie deficit.

We will also meet once a week (or twice a month) via zoom to hangout and talk about our process and progress. The goal is just to keep it positive, encouraging, and judgement-free at no cost.

I‚Äôve watched my roommate (M27) rather rapidly balloon in weight over the past 10 months. I‚Äôve been concerned since the winter when it started to become very obvious that he had been putting on a sizeable amount of weight.  He brought it up to me directly for the first time ever the other night rather casually, basically just asking if it‚Äôs obvious that he‚Äôs gained weight and if he seems to be oblivious to anything serious. Well, let me demonstrate:

I casually filmed [this video](https://imgur.com/a/iEYhSbz) of him sometime in February, when he was at least probably 30 pounds lighter than now. I saw him outside coming home from the store and couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes so I had to take a video. I was going to show him then to try to open a conversation, but decided it wasn‚Äôt my business. But I cannot believe he would go in public like this; really makes how oblivious he is very clear. 

However, more recently this month (again already at least 30 pounds bigger here), he was cleaning through his closet and trying on old clothes to donate. I started to film yet another [video](https://imgur.com/a/4NfV4zi) of him in attempt to help him realize how dismissive he was being because he was claiming that this shirt still fit him okay enough to wear. Obviously we can all see it does not. 

I think he‚Äôs finally starting to realize how out of hand his weight gain has become (which he informed me upon asking in our conversation this week that has been +100 pounds in 10 months - [video](https://imgur.com/a/d5dpkhA) he sent me from his office‚Äôs backdoor security camera last week). He said that his doctor said there are no indicators that it‚Äôs anything health-related besides his lifestyle and diet. He doesn‚Äôt seem to realize how bad this is though and needs to be snapped out of it before it‚Äôs too late. 

The most personally annoying thing is just that I know he sneaks some of my snacks and drinks when he runs out because stuff goes missing and he‚Äôs my only roommate‚Ä¶ nothing big, but it‚Äôs still frustrating. 

However, he‚Äôs still brushing off the urgency and doesn‚Äôt want to make any changes now. Can someone help him realize what‚Äôs happened to him and where he‚Äôs headed? It‚Äôs a bit sad.

1522,Take 3 with a change,"Hey guys, I'm trying IF for the 3rd time, failed twice but I'm making a change.

Bit of a back story, I'm 30, 5ft 10 and 18 stone (252lbs) and do have quite a bad diet of takeaways most nights because I'm being too lazy to cook. I've tried IF twice now on 20/4 but always ended up stopping as it was starting to effect my work as I felt I was lacking energy at it. I do have quite a active job of a storeman picking kitchens and the like for a huge joinery company in the UK.

When I tried fasting before I was having my evening meal around 8pm and fasting since then for the 20hrs, now I work 7:30-17:00 so found I was lagging really bad towards the end of my shifts and when I got home I was just ordering takeaways for my evening meal.

Into my change this time. I wake up around 06:00-06:30 so I've thought if I make my eating window around 07:30-11:30 (my lunch is usually at 11am) I could make myself breakfast in the morning and have it at work (my manager is cool with us eating in the warehouse) then just snack on like nuts and the like before having a good meal again at 11am before starting a fast again and also making sure that I have all my energy during my working hours.

To add to this I did download a paid app called mealtime which gives you healthy recipes to guide me to changing mt diet as I've tried to search online for resources for healthier meals but everything seems to pretty much be behind a pay wall anyway.

I also feel a bit 'slower', it's hard to explain. My body definitely uses less energy while fasting. After eating I feel 'back to normal' again and heartrate increases as well.

I'm doing IF for weight loss and trying to follow Jason Fung's guidance, since I'm obese and this seems to b his wheelhouse.  I started at 16:8 - found it too easy.

I start every lifestyle effort brilliantly, and then it all implodes at the first hurdle and it takes me months of binge eating and despair to get back on the wagon. Ugh.

Anyway, I broke my 36hr fast with breakfast and could not figure out why I now have to wait 12 hours to start the next fast.  (The IF schedules I've found online recommend 36:12 three times a week and then a 'rest' day on Sunday, for example).

But why can't I do 36hrs , then 1 meal, even if it takes 15mins, and then jump straight back into the next fast?

I‚Äôve been doing IF on and off since October and I‚Äôve lost and regained (due to holidays and a miscarriage in February) the same 15lbs at least twice now. At the end of February I quickly went from 215lbs to 205 during a few busy weeks when I was walking A TON and eating very limited meals, and since the beginning of March I‚Äôve been hovering between 199-203 back and forth. So for the past two months I‚Äôve been doing 18:6 IF, lifting weights with some cardio (I‚Äôm doing an awesome workout program called Get Mom Strong). I‚Äôve limited my sugar so only the occasional fruit and every now and then I eat chips or French fries, but most days I have a Greek salad for lunch and then whatever my family is having for dinner (I have a husband and three kids). Dinners aren‚Äôt always healthy but I try to avoid snacking between meals along with having a salad almost every day. We went on vacation last week and I ate donuts and churros and generally enjoyed myself so of course my weight went back up two pounds, but now that we are home I‚Äôm back on track.

The scale has just bouncing back and forth between 199 and 203 for the past two months but one of my friends says she can see a difference. Maybe I can too? I can see more definition in my shoulders and my glutes for sure, but this feels like really slow progress.

I REALLY want to lose 15lbs or more by August when we are going to visit friends and family, most of whom we haven‚Äôt seen for a few years.

1547,"My IF attempts always failed, until this accidental discovery","I have a weird body, atypical genetics in a few respects I guess. I won't go into all of it unless someone's really interested, but it does affect how I experience hunger, and later involves my IF discovery.

I do not get hungry easily, never have. It was common for me to not experience hunger at all growing up, not real physical hunger anyway, psychological hunger is one thing, craving another, but physical hunger pretty rarely.

I used to think my body was a super digester or perhaps a slow digester, I can feel food sitting in my stomach for many hours, up to 8-12 hours after eating, and the science does say the amount of energy some bodies can get out of food can be variable.

I would typical eat one meal a day, no snacking, and it might be large but it still didn't lead to losing weight.

In my 20s I once lost 60 lbs in 5 months and obtained my ideal weight of 180 for my height, but it was because I worked a physically demanding job that had me walking several miles a day exercising. I combined that with fasting until physically hungry, which could often take more than 24 hours for me, and then I would sleep on my physical hunger.

I can very easily sleep on hunger, I've heard some people cannot really do that but it was easy for me. 8 hours of hunger hormone really worked.

Now, years later and with some weight to take off, I found it difficult to repeat that feat. I'm not as physically active, but more than that, trying to fast to get to physical hunger simply *wasn't working*.

And the reason is because of what I've come to call 'panic hunger'.

I would try to get into that fasted state and would experience this panic hunger feeling that drove me to eat.

Always I would regret it afterwards and analyze the thought process that led to me sabotaging my goals and realize that I had literally lied to myself or simply rationalized wanting to eat, overcome my own resistance. That feeling of dire need overrided my goals.

What was I missing, was I simply weak willed, not committed enough to my goal, etc. I'd resolve to do better next time, but this turned into a common occurrence.

Because of this I've been stuck trying to lose weight unsuccessfully for a couple years now.

But then I started doing something new, something that would lead to my recent discovery and allow me to finally begin losing weight after years of resistance, and it was easy. One small tweak made all the difference, and maybe it might help others do the same.

Eating every other day wasn't working for me. I resolved finally that more fasting was the way forward, and not only that but I wanted to fast during the week and eat normally during the weekends. Just long enough that your digestion system doesn't shut down (that takes about 7 days).

So I began this. And randomly I had bought some instant miso soup packs a few days before to try out and I thought it would be a decent idea to eat one or two of these in the morning, as they are only 50 cals, that would make me happy to have this soup that I really truly enjoy.

So every day I would have two 8 oz glasses of instant miso soup, the pack had different flavors and veggies added in so it didn't get boring, and the stuff was actually nicely high quality. With some boiled water the veggies come out really nicely--food science has come a long way. I think they're freeze dried veggies and the miso paste is fresh packed.

A couple days into this regimen is when I noticed something seemed different.

Not only had I successfully gone several days without eating but I realized that I had not experienced any instances of panic hunger, something that I would typically absolutely have experienced by now. And that made me wonder.

Could it be that the miso soup was somehow making a difference?

The only thing in there that made any sense was the salt!

So I did some googling, is ""salt hunger"" a thing, could lack of salt make you hungry, could you body make you eat too get salt, could eating salt *actually prevent hunger* in some people?

What I found was conflicting information, some articles saying that yes eating salt can stave off hunger and some saying the opposite, but it absolutely did seem to be true for MY body, which I knew was already weird in some ways anyway, so being atypical on this wouldn't surprise me.

Some articles suggested that eating up to 2 grams of salt a day could prevent hunger.

So I went and looked at how much salt was in each miso packet, just under 1 gram. I was literally eating 1.9 grams of salt a day accidentally, which is what was being recommended.

Here's one article I found at that time:

https://www.livestrong.com/article/13767813-pink-himalayan-salt-fasting/

So, I've just begun this journey, but I can report that I'm down 16 pounds now, my clothes already fit much better, and I've got hope of reaching my goal weight after years of trying and my body refusing to budge.

Still a good ways to go, but that was after just a few weeks of salt fasting in this way. 

For some people, like me, adding salt while fasting could make a significant difference, especially if you experience the kind of panic hunger drive that I describe.

Now, every time I get a food craving I simply remind myself that I can have it on Saturday if I want :P it works, and I don't find myself driven to eat, in fact I don't even get hungry, but again, that's my weird body. I'm 36 hours into my current fast (because I had to break my fast early last week for a birthday so I'm moving the start of this fast up to this weekend), and I am not hungry. I was out and about earlier today and didn't trick myself into eating anything, and it wasn't a matter of self-control or will-power, I just didn't want any food!

Even with my buddy sending me some gorgeous BBQ rib YouTube videos, I simply told myself I can have em on Saturday and that's enough.

So, I write this to share my discovery with you, maybe a little miso soup in the morning can be that final piece of be puzzle that makes progress possible for you like it was for me, after many years of trying. You never know. 

Salt hunger, I never would've guessed that's what I was experiencing. Nor that just adding some salt to my diet would lead to such a breakthrough in progress.",intermittentfasting,1652051194

To get a bit technical, since fasting has made you ""switch"" from glucose-metabolism to fat-metabolism (ketones as energy source instead of fat) to a large extent, switching it back might cause some trouble because when the insulin tries to break the glucose, it may not find electrolytes (such as phosphate) in sufficient quantities so soon. Thus, the potentially fatal ""Refeeding Syndrome"" occurs and which is why experts advice you to break your fast slowly and gradually, and not try to binge eat at the very moment you break the fast.

What I want to know is how great is this risk for those of us who intermittently fast (typically 16-8)? From what I've read, this syndrome generally occurs only in those who are malnourished or fasted for a very long time. Still some expert opinion or advice on this would be helpful.",intermittentfasting,1652022250

1628,Total Newbie - is this likely to work for my circumstances?,"Hello and than you in advance for any helpful replies. Apologies that this is wordy, but I'd really like to know realistically if IF is likely to work for me given my circumstances?

I'm a 50 year old male in the UK, I'm approx 5ft 9 (175cm) and 17 stone (238lbs). For more than 25 years I have had depression, anxiety, insomnia and generally a total lack of energy and motivation. My diet is terrible and I know this will be adding to my problems. I would say I'm definitely fully addicted to eating junk. Doing so temporarily gives me a boost of happiness, energy and a feeling of being satisfied and full. 

I pretty much hate vegetables, eggs and any vegan type foods. I love meat but largely my regular diet consists of chocolate, biscuits (cookies), crisps (chips), sweets, pizza, battered chicken and chips (fat fries). Without this crap my mood is below low most of the time.  

My main evening meal is free 5 times a week as I deliver food in the evenings for a Chinese takeaway (chicken, beef, duck - all either in sauce and/or batter)! Giving this up may be smart but realistically it's not going to happen as it saves me a considerable amount of money every month plus mentally I don't have the oomph to start making proper meals. 

My hope with trying IF (I started yesterday btw) is that reducing the hours I am eating will at least cut out the junk for most of the day. I think to start with 16:8 is probably the way to get going, I've read several people say that they achieved no weight loss with this, so I'm concerned that may happen, but believe at least in starting with IF that it's more likely I'll stick to it than going straight to 18:6.

Day to day plan would be for the 5 days I work, 16:8 3pm to 11pm (I work 4.30pm to 9/10pm), eating soup before work and my free Chinese for dinner, trying to avoid all other junk. My 2 days off would still be 16:8 but would include my usual 2 day weekend treat meals (probably either a McDonald's/KFC/chippy meal) on each of those 2 days.

My usual drinks ALWAYS consisted of around 2 litres of diet fizzy drinks per day. I have recently become more and more concerned about the potential dangers of artificial sweeteners found in diet and regular drinks (Aspartame in particular), so I have now stopped drinking these. Water is sometimes nice sometimes boring so I've recently started drinking 1 litre of tomato juice a day, as a treat drink (180 cals) and to break the boredom of water, only drinking the juice in my 8 hours. Water in the 16.

Realistically is IF likely to work given my circumstances or am I just trying yet another thing destined to fail? I'm hopeful based on what I've read so far it could work.

Note: I used to take very strong anti depressants (I was on the maximum allowable doseage), they did not work for me unfortunately. Since coming off them my depression is pretty much the same but I no longer have the brain fog the meds caused. The only meds I take now are 20mg Atorvastatin (for cholesterol).


Again thanks in advance for wading through all this and any helpful advice you can offer me.

I went from IF window of 14:10 to 16:8 in a matter of a week and now have steadily been doing 18:6 since at least the first week of April. I am closely monitoring and managing my CICO numbers. My TDEE is somewhere like 1900-2000, MFP says for me to lose weight I need to keep at 1650 calories, and have been able to do so and then some. Most times I can barely make it over 1200 calories a day within my 6-hour window but I am usually between 1200 and 1400.. I've had only 3 cheat days where I went over my recommended caloric count.

I see these incredibly motivating posts and folks are saying they are losing about 2 or 3 lbs a week. They are near or similar to my body size etc. but I can't seem to mimic the same results.

Am I going about this too quickly? I was thinking about keeping this schedule for 10 days but it‚Äôs feeling rough. I know that sugar withdrawal has something to do with it, but I also know that carbs are my #1 weight gain issue. (I also take Paxil and birth control, which doesn‚Äôt help). Should I transition to 16 hours at this point, or is it worth pushing through for 5 more days? I have a decent amount of willpower.

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice you have. I‚Äôve cobbled together detoxing ideas from various online sites but I‚Äôm a huge newbie to that.

1706,"The genesis of IF success lies in the fact that we humans evolved in a feast-famine cycle of food supply, not an abundance of it","Since day one, we have been taught that food was like an essential thing for survival, that food provides us with nutrition and energy to sustain ourselves and whatnot. While that may be technically true, a pattern of gluttonous binge eating isn't exactly what mother nature had in mind when she evolved human beings.

If you think about it, most of the human history were riddled with cycles of feast and famine, with latter being more lasting and more menacing. Food was not only scarce in most of that time but also unpredictable. Indeed, if food was as essential for our survival as today's nutrition experts and food industry makes out to be, don't you think our race would have been extinct a long long time time!

Au contrary, all our body organs and especially our brains are designed to work super efficiently when there is a lack of food! It's only when you don't get a meal (during fasting, for example) does the survival instinct kicks in. In this regard, consider food to be that answer to a riddle or prize that you seek at the end of a quest. However, what keeps your machine active and energized is not the prize, but the quest itself!

Is it a mere coincidence that almost all cultures and traditions of the world recommend at least some form of fasting for health? The Romans understood the feast-famine cycle as early as 1st century BCE and they prescribed ways of artificially creating famine cycles (i.e. fasting) when food was aplenty during the feast cycle. Hinduism prescribes *Ekadasi*, a form of fortnightly fasting. Both Jainism and Buddhism texts forbid eating post the sunset. Islam has Ramadan fasting for one whole month which is nothing but a form of Intermittent Fasting.

Believe me, I've tried all forms of modern so called ""dietary strategies"" like keto diet, low carb diet, plain old low calorie diet, eating less sugar foods, etc. All this is nothing but a propaganda by big food industry to keep you distracted from the real deal which is fasting. When it comes to losing weight or staying healthy/fit or even preventing diseases, there is just no alternative to fasting. And while there are many forms of fasting and all work to some extent, IF is just more practically suited to today's sedentary lifestyle. My word of advice is: don't fall for any propaganda and just go for it. It doesn't cost you a dime to do it, and that's why they're so worried!",intermittentfasting,1651826262

1724,Fasting while recovering from surgery,"Not anything super major, but I'm getting 3 wisdom teeth taken out this weekend. I will continue to do 20:4 as per usual, but have a few questions for anyone who has gone through surgeries while doing IF. 

1 - Would it be okay to go in a fasted state? My eating window starts at 8am and ends at 12pm, the surgery would be in the early morning and I'd already be past 20 hours of fasting. Not sure if that's okay or if I should eat before leaving the house. I have done up to like 46 hrs before; I know I'd be fine past the 20 hours in other circumstances. 

2 - Should I stick to my usual caloric intake or should I eat more to aid recovery? I don't want to gain nor lose weight as I finally found my sweet spot and am maintaining, so changing my caloric intake is something I kinda fear right now.  

3 - I already have a decent food plan, but never bad to have more ideas, so feel free to let me know what nutritious foods you suggest for someone after having teeth taken out. 

4 - Out of curiosity, do you think fasting 18+ hrs actually aids recovery due to autophagy? In which case, would you recommend going down to OMAD for max healing benefits? It would work for me, I just rather 20:4 so I'm not too uncomfortably full.

1725,"Best way to motivate yourself out of bad eating habits &amp; cravings? Planning to start a diet change Monday after gaining a decent amount of weight in the past 10 months or so (102 pounds). I (M27) have done a lot of research of what to actually eat, but hearing how people motivate would be great.","

I've (M27) absolutely let my diet get away from me in the past year and have basically let myself eat whatever I want, when I want.  It started off as bad habits from working at home at the beginning of this time frame that simply continued even when I returned back to in-office work.  I've gone from about 170lbs to 272lbs in the past 10.5 months, which I know is a bit quick.  My doctor saw me recently and did a lot of tests to make sure I didn't have any health conditions that could be exacerbating this weight gain - ultrasound, hormone tests, blood test, thyroid, etc - and didn't find anything, attributing it to my diet &amp; lifestyle changes.  

So, my diet is obviously rather bad.  I didn't realize just how bad it was getting until the past couple of months once I've gotten a bit bigger now: I can't touch my toes and can barely put my shoes on, get out of breath going up one flight of stairs to my apartment, can't squeeze into some restaurant booths, have had so many weeks where I wake up late for work and can't find something clean to wear that will button.  It‚Äôs even affected my performance in the workplace because I‚Äôm not as mobile and am constantly racing to upsize my clothes to be presentable enough in public. And after a truly nightmarish day today where it seemed like the world was out to get me for being fat now, I am determined to make some changes.  Starting Monday with my diet!

I'd love advice on the diet itself, but I've done a lot of reading here for that.  I mostly would like to know how people really motivate themselves not to give into cravings and temptations to overeat.  I'm so worried about my willpower of being able to do this, and hearing other success stories might help me out.  I don't really know how I let myself get to this point so fast at 27, but it's dawning on me now that this rate of weight gain needs to be stopped.  Thanks in advance.",intermittentfasting,1651798907

1791,Breaking fast for weight loss... How much is too much?,"Hopefully this isn't another repeat question... I did try to research. :)

For specific context, I am talking about drinks in a 16:8 fast. From reading online articles and comments, the gist I'm getting is that some drinks may end up breaking a fast, but if you are fasting for weight loss, the benefits can still be possible. Do correct me if I'm wrong...

My question is, if you are drinking something that will break a fast, how much is too much? From what I understand, pretty much any amount of calories/carbs/protein/fat will break a fast, but is there a standard or rule as too a number to stay under? Something like, if it's under x amount of calories or doesn't contain carbs, it should be ""okay""? Is that a thing?

If we want to be really specific... below is an example of a instant latte mix I used to drink before fasting. I'm assuming this 100% will break a fast, but how badly? If I found a similar product with everything cut by over 50% and mixed with water, would that be acceptable or should I just stuck with simple tea?

Kinda understandable, but it seems these videos make it way easier for me to keep up the IF in a roundabout way. Does anyone else have experience with (something like) this?

1810,(20f) seeing great results but disliking my new face- i almost want to give up IF," tl,dr; lost 11kgs and 6 inches off my waist, face now looks worse. does this get better in time?

hi everyone. i started IF around October 2021 as when i got weighed at the doctor's, i was at 69kgs which is overweight for my height of 5'5. since then i've lost 11 kgs, which in itself is amazing! i feel very proud of myself. however, losing weight is actually just a side effect of my main goal of reaching a 25in waist. i started at 31in, now i'm at 27in(i could reach 25 if i suck it in hard enough lol), so i only have a little bit to go.

my problem now is my nasolabial folds that seemed to suddenly crop up overnight. they're not wrinkles, it's like sagging baby fat on my cheeks. i spotted them 3 days ago. ever since then, i stopped sleeping on my side in hopes that it was just sleep wrinkles, but it hasn't gone away. i get good 6-8hrs of sleep every night, i'm well hydrated, i still keep a good diet, i have a regular skincare routine that includes spf and tretinoin, and i don't feel any emotional stress- meaning this has to have been a side effect of weight loss. this has really disheartened me, and now i want to stop my journey to return to where i was before.

is this just a case of some parts of my face losing fat before the others? do i still have to trust in the process until i reach my goal? will my age help my skin return to its previous state? or should i simply stop fasting now? any advice/experiences/reassurance would be really really helpful. thanks in advance everyone!",intermittentfasting,1646712008

1832,Just started OMAD for autophagy but not weight loss!,"So, I really don't know all that much about health and nutrition and such, but I started OMAD five days back and it has been going well. For some reason I found the third day to be a challenge, however, it seems to be getting easier each day.

I've done a few 30 hour, 48 hour, and 60 hour dry fasts in the past, so this wasn't totally brand new to me, however, I figured OMAD can enable me to fast for much longer overall (such as a few months).

The reason I am doing it is for health reasons. The autophagy affects. That's what I am hoping for.

I haven't put much thought into what I eat as such. I just grab a bunch of stuff from my fridge, and then eat it within an hour time window (actually it ends up being more like 2 hours).

However, I am a bit chubby and so I do have some weight to lose, and I just started thinking, if I am going to do OMAD for several weeks/months, I might as well take advantage of the potential weight loss that it could bring.

Do you think I am likely to lose weight anyway, just by the fact that I am not eating the same quantity of food I would commonly be eating in a given day.

Or should I really put more thought into the actual OMAD meal itself. I do have a sugar weakness, and I was thinking, at least having something sugary in my OMAD allows me to stick to omad. You know? It carries me through to the next day and the next day. If you see what I mean. To cut it out completely, makes the whole thing much harder.

Or maybe I am doing it wrong? I don't know.

In general, I hate the idea of specifically counting calories.

Autophagy is the main goal, but losing some weight along the way would be a great bonus and might motivate me to keep going. But then again, cutting out sugar completely might make me ultimately fail and then just go back to not fasting.

I don't know.

It suits my daily schedule and I don‚Äôt usually find it that hard, I don‚Äôt get very hungry, and generally speaking it‚Äôs comfortable. 

The problem is that during certain times of my cycle my appetite changes and all. I. can. Think. about is carbs and sugar. It‚Äôs taken me years to identify this pattern - I thought I had crap willpower and no character but that‚Äôs not it. (And anyone who‚Äôs experienced this kind of hormonal cravings and resisted - good on you, but I haven‚Äôt managed it so far because it‚Äôs HARD). It happens over and over again at the same time of the month. And even when I‚Äôve fasted at least 18 hours a day for, say, 12 days in 2 weeks, the scales aren‚Äôt budging. 

I put on some weight a few years ago when I entered perimenopause without knowing there was such a thing. I ate and ate and ate. Now I‚Äôm on HRT and so many things are much, much better. My weight has stayed stable at the new level for several years, so I‚Äôm not putting on more with my current eating habits. 

But I‚Äôm not losing either. I really wish I could lose with IF because it seems to suit me.

I don't own weighing scales and I honestly think I'd become too obsessive over the number, but I estimated I was probably somewhere around 350lbs when starting and 6'4 height so maybe even a little higher. I did have to take some measurements recently for a suit for my friends' wedding and my waist seemed to have dropped by somewhere between 2 - 4 inches (and the pants were still too big), same for my chest too.

If you take it, how much? When? Can you reasonably attach any success you've had with IF to exogenous ketones? (Like, you ate the same way before and after using it, but after using it you lost more weight). I fast from 10 PM to 2 PM and usually get up at 7 or 8 AM, when I have my first coffee of the day. When should I have the ketones?

This supplement is all the rage in PCOS circles, but I assume some here use it too. I know what it says on the box, but how do YOU take it? When (like, when in your eating cycle).

1861,"A sort of cautionary tale, a bit: How I fucked up my gallbladder by being a dumbass.","Hi all,

I want to preface this by saying that I am not accusing IF of damaging me. My motivation in posting this is that fasting is one of the contributing factors to what happened to me. There were others. This is absolutely not solely the fault of IF, but it could be part of it.

I am also posting because I was not aware that I could be at risk for this to happen, and if you are dumbass like me, you need to know that this could happen to you. People often choose to lose weight because they're turning their lives around, and if the thing they were turning from is as bad as mine, well. You see.

Also I am still doing IF, as my doctors have told me it is perfectly safe to do so now. So there‚Äôs that.

TL;DR: This was 100% my fault, but if you are a dumb fuck like me, you could end up losing your gall bladder if you fast. But then you can fast again because you don‚Äôt have a gallbladder anymore. You may, if you are American, have spectacular medical debt, though.

**LONG VERSION**

I started IF in December. I am doing OMAD mostly, but I cheat some days and eat lunch too - still 16:8 amirite? I also started C25K, and am now running at least 5km 3 times a week. I feel better than I have in years.

And it's working. I am down 22 pounds so far, and I love how choosing suppertime as my One Meal allows me to eat with my family as usual - it‚Äôs the one meal where we all sit down together. In case you're wondering, I do the cooking in my family, and we eat healthy - lots of Asian-inspired stir fries at the moment, with noodles or jasmine rice, and interesting arty farty salads. 

I could lose faster if I did keto, but I‚Äôm happy with what I‚Äôve achieved, and I‚Äôm ok with it taking a while. I didn‚Äôt get fat overnight, and I won‚Äôt get to goal weight overnight either.

**THE FUCKUP BEGINS**

On Tuesday last week, I experienced severe pain. If 10 is the max you can experience without going insane, I would rate this a 7. It was like there was fire in my abdomen, and it would not stop. I was horping from the pain, head stuck in the bowl.

Luckily my wife had some industrial grade painkillers left over from something else, and I eventually managed to keep them down, so I finally fell asleep. 

Next day I was fine, maybe food poisoning?

**NARRATOR: IT WASN‚ÄôT FOOD POISONING**

On Wednesday evening, it came back with a vengeance. The pain level was 9.5 now. I was literally thrashing on the floor screaming. I am a big guy, I handle my shit, but I was weeping like a baby. My wife phoned her mom to come over, and we got in the car.

She‚Äôs a bit shit in the bends, but when the road straightens out a little, she can shift like a motherfucker. I was impressed. But also, I was screaming.

We got to casualty, where I was crying so hard they took me straight into a private room because I was freaking out all the other patients, stuck a drip in me, and pushed morphine. It growled and retreated to a 6. I could have kissed that nurse.

I keep mentioning the crying not for narrative drama, but because I want you to understand how incredibly painful what was happening was. This is not a fucking joke.

**WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?**

Doc did a sonar. They saw something around my gallbladder but it was inconclusive. They ordered a CT, but that was inconclusive too. They could see that the gallbladder was inflamed, but they couldn't see any stones, so why the hell does it look like that? 

Then they ordered an MRI, which gave them the confirmation they needed: my gallbladder is fucked. They have to remove it.

**IT‚ÄôS AN OWN GOAL**

I am not a doctor, so if I get this wrong don‚Äôt downvote me to shit. I‚Äôm just explaining what I understood.

So the gallbladder fills up with bile, and waits for you to eat. When you eat, it dumps the bile into your stomach, to help you digest things like fats.

But if you don‚Äôt eat, the bile begins to concentrate, and depending how long you fast, it can superconcentrate. When that happens, something for which the medical term is literally ‚Äúbile sludge‚Äù builds up in the gallbladder. It‚Äôs made up of nasty, nasty shit, and when your gallbladder fills up with sludge, holy crap will you know about it.

Now, 1 in 5 men are actually at risk of this happening, and it's double for women for reasons I don't understand. Fasting alone can but probably won't cause it on its own, you kind of need more than one hit on the causes list. I have a couple, because I am a garbage human being.

Rapid weight loss is also on the list, so that‚Äôs concerning. But in my case, I think it was what I was doing before I got my shit together and decided to get healthy, and specifically, that was drinking a bottle of whisky a day for about the better part of year.

I do own my fuckups. I did this to myself. And the irony is that when I decided to get well, I made it worse. 

**SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS?**

The only solution at the point I was at, is to remove the gallbladder, which is what they did two days later. My insurance won‚Äôt pay if I leave the hospital because it‚Äôs then an elective procedure, not an emergency one, so the dumb fucks had to pay for the bed for 5 days instead of 2, but what do I care, right? It's only time off work.

I was on painkillers, and Nil Per Os until the surgery, which basically means they push saline into your veins to keep you hydrated but no food because they need your guts to be empty. If you have stuff in your stomach, the anaesthetic can make you puke into your lungs which nobody wants.

**IT GOT A BIT REAL**

Guys this was the most fucked up part.

After surgery they bring you round to make sure your lungs are working on their own after having been intubated. It felt like someone had heated a sword in a furnace, stabbed me through the gut, and was twisting it around for fun. I could not stop crying.

They pushed morphine. It did nothing. They pushed a bunch of of others whose names I cannot remember, but which I am reliably informed are the heavy hitters the bring out if morphine turns out to be useless. 

None of it so much as moved the needle. I saw the increasing concern on their faces and I realised how fucked I actually was.

Panic set in then, and despair. And then the horrible realisation that I would actually rather be dead. And I was afraid of that. And then suddenly I wasn‚Äôt. It was OK. I could die. My wife would be OK, she‚Äôs so strong. And her relationship with her mom will improve because she‚Äôll need her help with the boys. And the boys will grieve too, but they know about death from the passing of their grandfather, so they‚Äôll be OK. They‚Äôll survive without me. I can go. I‚Äôm OK with this. I‚Äôm ready.

Christ, they‚Äôve pushed so much into me, it‚Äôll probably stop my heart anyway. I need a little more though.

And then I started pleading with them to kill me. Please, it‚Äôs OK, nobody will hold you responsible, it was clearly an accident, help me please, please fucking help me, just a little more.

And they wouldn‚Äôt, and I hated every fucking one of them.

Then I passed out.

**SO IS THERE A LESSON HERE?**

No, not really. I survived. I‚Äôm sore but I‚Äôm OK. I can‚Äôt digest fatty foods easily anymore. Can‚Äôt drink either, really. Can‚Äôt run for five weeks. And I‚Äôm dealing with the knowledge that I absolutely got to this point because of my own terrible choices. I need to do better. I will do better. 

I‚Äôm telling this story because maybe one of you has been a stupid fuck like me, and was trying to drink their problems away. If that is you, I want you to know that under no circumstances do you want the experience I had. Please get checked out by your GP. 

Most of the time, gallbladder problems can be diagnosed with a simple sonar; my case was extreme. If you catch it earlier, you can fix it just with dietary changes. How crazy is that?

For the rest of you, will this happen to you? Probably not. It could, I suppose, because fasting is a contributing factor, but I think it‚Äôs pretty unlikely.

1896,Just started OMAD for autophagy but not weight loss!,"So, I really don't know all that much about health and nutrition and such, but I started OMAD five days back and it has been going well.  For some reason I found the third day to be a challenge, however, it seems to be getting easier each day.

I've done a few 30 hour, 48 hour, and 60 hour dry fasts in the past, so this wasn't totally brand new to me, however, I figured OMAD can enable me to fast for much longer overall (such as a few months).

The reason I am doing it is for health reasons.  The autophagy affects.  That's what I am hoping for.

I haven't put much thought into what I eat as such.  I just grab a bunch of stuff from my fridge, and then eat it within an hour time window (actually it ends up being more like 2 hours).

However, I am a bit chubby and so I do have some weight to lose, and I just started thinking, if I am going to do OMAD for several weeks/months, I might as well take advantage of the potential weight loss that it could bring.

Do you think I am likely to lose weight anyway, just by the fact that I am not eating the same quantity of food I would commonly be eating in a given day.

Or should I really put more thought into the actual OMAD meal itself.  I do have a sugar weakness, and I was thinking, at least having something sugary in my OMAD allows me to stick to omad.  You know?  It carries me through to the next day and the next day.  If you see what I mean.  To cut it out completely, makes the whole thing much harder.

Or maybe I am doing it wrong?  I don't know.  

In general, I hate the idea of specifically counting calories.

Autophagy is the main goal, but losing some weight along the way would be a great bonus and might motivate me to keep going.  But then again, cutting out sugar completely might make me ultimately fail and then just go back to not fasting.

Just looking to lose about 5lbs to get back to my pre-pan weight. I run/walk usually about 10k-12k or 5 miles a day.  I'm a vegetarian and have typically eaten whole foods for several years. 

A few years ago I lost like 15lbs counting calories after an accident that caused me to be confined to a chair for 6 weeks. I got obsessive over counting calories and I didn't ever want to go back to that mindset so I thought I'd try IF this time.  I have been doing 18/6 for about a month now and lost two pounds right away but I haven't lost anything since. Many days I struggle to make it to my feeding window where I'm just so damn hungry, foggy and listless. I am drinking ""fasting salts"", a homemade snake juice recipe as well.  

I'm kind of wondering why the heck I am doing this if I am so hungry all the time and am still going to have to count calories to lose weight. I could just eat all day, count calories and lose weight.... BUT like I said, I really don't want to go back to that mindset.

What I've tried to improve the results: this past week I'm eating normally during my feeding window, but am trying keto recipes as the last thing I eat before my fasting window starts again. I've also added a couple tablespoons of MCT oil to my coffee to try to get me to through the last couple hours of my fasting window.

1921,"what difference have people found in health &amp; weight-loss between *just* intermittent fasting, keto (with or without IF), and just cutting out sugar?","Hey folks,

I've been going down the most 'extreme' / strict of the 3 diet-change roads...I've been eating keto with an IF schedule of 16:8. Keto, just by it's nature, includes cutting out sugar.

I had success with keto in the past, a couple of years ago (last few months of 2019) - lost 15kg in 3 months. Found it too strict though and started eating whatever, whenever again. I wonder if my desire to BINGE lots of junk for a good year after keto wasn't just the pandemic (I stopped keto around the start of 2020), but was also the strictness of the diet messing me up. I've since done some reading on how binging and weight-gain can be caused by being overly-strict with ourselves...and that moderate, sustainable changes can be the way to go.

When I look into people who have lots the weight, gotten healthy and \*stayed\* that way (for years), they tend to have a few things in common:

1. cutting \*back\* on sugar and processed junk type food

2. eating more veggies

3. increasing physical activity (not  necessarily  gym-junkies, but some sort of moving each day, even if it's just parking further away from your destination and walking the last couple of blocks), 

4. intermittent fasting in \*some\* form, whether it's 16:8, or having a couple of days a week of OMAD.

I've gone back on keto, the last couple of weeks, but I'm finding it tricky. I'm already thinking to myself about an upcoming trip away at easter with friends, and how I will have to restrict what I eat and absent myself from some of the social things.

I don't want to keep eating the way I was either though...prior to two weeks ago I was in patterns of eating lollies / sweets most days, take-away like McDonalds, pizza, KFC a few times a week, and just feeling crappy.

Seeing people on here lose weight with mainly intermittent fasting, I'm wondering if something more moderate might be sustainable for me...more so than keto. I've been in the ""sugarfree"" sub too, where some people are doing IF, others not, and many people there are getting incredible results from just quitting sugar.

I'm curious what people's experiences have been with any combination of just IF alone, quitting sugar, eating keto (where sugar and pretty much all carbs are cut out and fat is increased, it's much more strict than either of the first two).

My Blood sugars are typically in the 110 to 16 range during the day or even lower.  However, I have noticed that when I go for a walk and check my blood sugar it can be in the 140-150 range.

1978,"Update to earlier post about not being able to lose weight, no matter what I did!","Y'all! I am so excited! I posted a little more than a month ago. I had been steadily gaining weight despite cutting calories for YEARS. I tried IF for a month, and I loved IF but after the first month, my weight would still go up if I ate poorly even ONCE. And it wasn't water weight. It was sticking around. Everyone was so nice and had some suggestions... and it turns out... 

It was the decaf coffee! 

It should have been obvious but I guess I was still stuck in CICO. I've been using coffee and decaf coffee to skip meals for YEARS. And those years are exactly the same years that I have been steadily gaining weight even though I keep eating less and less. You would think that eating and exercising the same would mean that I would lose weight if I just replaced some of my usual calories with coffee. But apparently that's not how it works - and I had cut my calories down SO FAR. 

I don't know why this happens. But someone told me to cut out the coffee. Now I'm still doing 20:4 IF. I'm still eating pretty much the same as I was before (about 1200 calories a day). But finally, finally, finally I am losing weight consistently! 
I'm down at least six pounds from where I was when I posted before. That doesn't sound like a lot for a month of effort, but it's the first time my efforts have really paid off (including the summer I gave up all sugar, and the three months I ate only ""whole foods"" - didn't lose a pound either time and immediately gained weight when I started eating more normally). 

My best guess is that somehow the coffee was canceling out the fasting benefits? It must have taken me out of a fasted state. I don't know. I'm just so excited that finally my bodyweight seems to be at least somewhat connected to my diet.  I'll probably cut calories more later to lose a little bit faster, but for now I'm just enjoying the slow, steady progress :)",intermittentfasting,1646431675

So I'm 2017 I started keto. I was amazing and completely motivated because I was doing it with someone that I idolized (friend of mine, she's just... Awesome). She and I were super good about it and great accountability buddies. I started to show results instantly and seeing her do the same was motivating. We built off of each other's successes. I added in the gym 6 months after I started and was losing more and more bad weight and getting trimmer and crazy in shape. 
She and I lost contact with each other as she had some personal stuff going on, and I kept driving forward myself. I was a rockstar. I looked and felt amazing. I was gaining tone and delicious muscle and losing fat. 
Then march 2020. 
I couldn't get to the gym, succumbed into depression and extreme loneliness. I lost all my motivation and my drive. 
I gained back everything I had lost and lost everything I had gained. 
Now I'm struggling with self hatred again, not able to wear any of my clothes except just sweats and oversized leggings. 
She gave up as well and is just happy with being out of shape and non athletic anymore. I still love her, just hope she's doing what's best for her. 

I'm having a ton of difficulty getting back on the horse. I don't remember how to get started back where I was in the beginning, since over the time when I became fat adapted and working out, I was basically on OMaD. I struggle with binging even when I am not hungry. I just can't look in my mirrors any more. 
I'm at the gym and ashamed at my body for not lifting and having the endurance I had. 
I know it's not logical for me to be so mad about losing progress when I couldn't do anything to keep it up, but it's so hard to get back on. 

For those that succeeded in spades, and then lost everything, how did you get back on track? 
(Please do not just tell me to fast right off the bat. I literally can't get my mind to do it yet.)

And I had a few bad meals and several beers. 

When I got home, I expected the worst. What actually happened was that I had ""only"" gained about 3 lbs... which melted off in ONE DAY. I'm assuming water weight thanks to increased sodium intake. After that, the weight started dropping again like crazy. 

Now, it has stabilized somewhat... and I'm back to a slow-but-steady crawl toward my goal. 

All of this is to say that taking a week off and caring a LOT less about being meticulous seems to have actually resulted in getting me even closer to my ultimate goal, rather than setting me back.

My progress so far: https://i.imgur.com/cg5kLWY.jpg

**For waking up:**

Starbucks Espresso - curbs hunger, doesn't break fast, and provides caffeine

Mountain Dew Energy - 25 Calories, doesn't taste artificial (to me), 180mg of caffeine during eating periods 

**For snacking:**

Annie's Cheese Puffs: super low calories, filling, taste pretty darn good. 

Baked Flaming Hot Cheetos: 50% lower calories than regular Hot Cheetos. Drinking water with these makes you feel full faster. 

Snyder's Buffalo Pretzels: Not too bad calorie wise, very filling, Same as above with water intake.  

Blackberries: Very low calories, hits that sweet or sour craving. 

Spicy foods in general I've found help curb my hunger at the end of the night before my fasting time begins.

**Counting calories**

MyFitnessPal app: After using it for two weeks in a row it became a habit. I could not do this without it.

**Weigh ins** 

After I pee every morning I weigh myself. (Sorry for TMI, but I feel that may matter in helping take off that extra weight you want to see for motivation) 

**Cheat day and non fasting days**

Every single Friday after work I start my cheat day (well, cheat night) I look forward to it. I don't go overboard. It's my goal for each week. Sure it may slow progress by a little bit, but it's what stops me from cheating my diet throughout the week. ""Oh that new xxx at Taco Bell sounds so good. Guess I'll try it Friday!"" Instead of trying to squeeze in that 1000 calorie garbage into my eating period.

Sometimes I can only count calories on my weekends. I simply cant fast on those days due to family obligations, special events, time with my wife, etc. I don't want to miss my families home cooked meals and such. Living life is important too. At 8:00pm on Sunday I begin my fast again. 

**The fasting schedule**

I've set my fasting to a rough 16:8.

12:00pm to 8:00pm is my eating timeframe. But, I'm usually busy at work around 12:00, so I don't get to start eating until 1-2ish. I never adjust when the eating period ends, so I just tally it up to an extended fast. 

**That's about it**

You can turn this diet into **almost whatever you want** and it works. Hopefully someone out there struggling to stick to some schedule or diet that's just not working for them can see this.

My main goal is health, I want to reduce my risks of heart disease and cancer, which killed my father at age 68, as well as avoid type 2 diabetes. I also want to FEEL better, be able to enjoy vacations with my daughter and husband the way I used to. I love exploring and I started getting out of breath even on short walks, having trouble with my knees and ankles, and it's just depressing not being able to do the things I want to.

I've lost 5 lbs so far and to be honest I wish it would go faster, but I have to remind myself that previous ""diets"" I've been on were not sustainable and caused rebound weight gain. So I'm taking it day by day and making it a lifestyle vs a temporary thing. I'm using the Zero app, which was recommended here, and it's been really motivating and helpful. I pretty much just start my fast timer immediately after dinner, and it's great that I don't have to think about what time to break my fast the next day b/c it reminds me.

If that is correct and the metabolic side of their study is a cause, not a result... then IF would be a way to decrease the effects of the condition, (Not hoping for a Cure, don't worry)

2089,Could You Help Me In Fasting Techniques and Tips?,"Hello everyone!

38y, Male, 125kg/275lbs, 185cm/6,1ft

I'm starting my fast today because I want my liver back in order from early-state non-fatty liver disease and loose weight (about 20kg would be great!) and be more healthier and energetic in general. It would be nice to get back some of that lively youth I seem to have lost over the years, too. It really is now or never, because I'm getting older and I should have already reacted earlier when I found myself eating too much sugary crap. I was about 95-100kg's (210lbs) two years ago. I now have finally also stopped taking almost all the medications that did their part in accumulating all that weight that seems all to be in my belly... :(

I have a box of electrolyte powder made for keto diets so that should be fine. I have some experience with water fasting, but it was so long ago and I feel like I were a totally different person back then, so I'm starting from the very beginning and would like to hear all about how you managed your first fasting and what were the biggest problems that perhaps made it a difficult process? Is there some tips or techniques you feel are necessary to make it less horrible experience in the beginning, to lower the possibility that you start to feel depressed, anxious, scared and hopeless in addition to being hungry? I know it gets better, but even a day can seem pretty long, when you're fighting against your feelings and instincts still tell you to get energy from an external source. Any and all help concerning this would be gold, because in addition to sleeplessness, it's the main concern I have about the whole thing.

I really love a homemade Walnut, Blueberry and Banana smoothie as first and last meal and I'm wondering how much intake is okay or do Blueberry's contain too much sugar or Walnuts too much fats, although they are good fats? I also like to eat Oatmeal, Kiwis, Onions, Chicken and Eggs to mention a few, so what do you think about them in context of loosing weight and staying in some kind of elevated state of metabolism? I already decided to give up meat for a little while and give my digestive organs a break. The ultimate goal is to get healthier and happier. I'm really interested about Ketosis too, but definitely afraid to go through with it, mainly because I've never discussed with anyone who really knows and does it. I have experiences being in ketosis and really loved the feeling but controlling it and getting back to it now seems so far away. 

I do intermittent fasting naturally, because I don't usually eat anything between about 9pm and 1-2pm, so it gives me about 16 hours a day, and the main problem is that I eat too much in between. If I get really hungry I just fill my belly in a panic with example bananas, nuts, oatmeal, berries and/or probiotic yoghurt or make a supersmoothie containing a bit of everything I can find. But the total amounts are ridiculous evidently, because I haven't lost any weight after changing my diet to more healthy foods, as partly listed above. I feel so so much better ever since, though, but still have a crazy amount of fat in my belly and my insides are swimming in a fatty stew and that's gotta stop here, no matter what... 

I think the ingredients are there, I just need to learn discipline for what, when and how much to take. I'm sure that I eat way too much sweet fruits for example. What could be good alternatives in your opinion and how to make due with smaller portions? I've tried adding lots of fiber, but haven't really noticed any really positive from it, so maby I already had enough of fiber and prebiotics in my diet? I mainly use flax and hempseeds in addition to raw fruits and oatmeal, but theres loads of other nutrients in them too, like fats and protein. How do you get enough fiber yourself? Some affordable supplement perhaps, like psyllium? I really have struggled with too slow bowel movements and must 

I used to exercise when I was younger and now starting to go to the gym again, so that part is gonna finally be okay too and will surely burn some of the fat...

Any help would be greatly appreciated, because no matter what, today is the day that I will remember as the day I started really controlling my diet and quitting excess energy consumption. It would be awesome if someone would share their experience with me about how they managed to loose weight pretty fast and how to manage a healthy fasting procedure and how to handle and preferably avoid the hopeless feeling when hunger attacks. I really really want to learn and change for the better. I were a bit overweight as a child before puberty and again starting two years ago, but for almost 30 years I've been pretty slim so I'm confident my body acclimates to normal weight again, if I just show it how to...

But I have built up such confidence in my OMAD that recently, when I have had lunch, I can then skip for the rest of the day. Yes, we are masters of our own hunger, up to a certain extent.

But this has me wondering with respect to autophagy.

Of course, I wanted to keep pushing with it, but due to a series of unfortunate events (break up, Christmas, depression), I've been struggling to keep with my IF, and my cheat days are basically shitshows were I cannot stop myself from eating, even when I'm not hungry. I got back 12lbs.

I've been trying to get back to this for a couple months now and concentrate on bettering myself, but I feel like it's a lost fight so far. In the past two months I''ve lost some weight again, currently at 158lbs, but I can't break past that number. And on top of that, the hunger pains are huge this time, I get headaches and overall, I don't feel good and I don't see any changes in my physical appearance.

The past 2 months I've been doing 20:4 and OMAD, little to no exercise (last year I lost everything without moving, now I'm trying to build a walking habit but it's been hard to keep). I don't think I eat too much in my eating period, yet I'm not getting any progress and is discouraing me a lot and my morale is pretty much broken. 

Do you guys have any advise to share? Someone lived something similar and pushed through? Maybe some kind words? I need something to boost myself and keep myself at the game. I keep lurking and seeing successful stories of other people in this sub that makes me so happy, and I want just to be like them and become the better version of myself, and now I'm not sure IF is helping me achieving that.

I started on July 1 and have been water fasting since with the exception of a birthday for my dad on the 5th where we had steak and salad. I plan on continuing to fast with nothing but water and having the occasional eggs and yogurt meal every few days for protein as I'm also working out during this time and want to lose a lot of weight but not too much muscle mass.

Every day I have an hour long brisk walk minimum, but can be longer depending on how I feel.
I do some dumbell curls for 30 minutes, then practice on my punching bag for another 30. 

I plan on buying beat saber for my VR and also use that  for an extra hour out of the day on the more workout-y songs.

I started at about 165, which is about 40 lbs over my recommended weight, but at my age, I'd be comfortable at 145 as long as this stupid chin waddle thing goes away and I lose the muffin top.

I've tried IF on and off a couple of times, but I never made it more than a few days. I decided to give it a real try about 2 weeks ago (although I've fallen off the wagon quite a bit on weekends), and I've dropped a few pounds in water weight. Here's what I've been doing:

* 16:8 on weekdays (eat 12 to 8); I'll have black coffee or plain green tea.
* Not really following it weekends, but trying to make sure I don't eat anything until it's been at least 12 hours.
* No real change to activity level or alcohol consumption (I walk my dog every day, and sometimes I do pushups; I probably have about 3-5 drinks per week on average but I've cut beer out entirely).

For the last couple of days, I've been doing 16:8 but almost like a modified OMAD where at noon, I break my fast with a Kencko smoothie and maybe some jerky or fruit, and then don't eat again until dinner. I think I like that.

Going forward, here's my plan:

* 16:8 on weekdays, starting my eating period with very light foods and eating whatever I want at dinner time (eating 12 to 8).
* Try for 16:8 on weekends, but not going to sweat it if I screw up a day because I wanted to get breakfast with a friend.
* 2 cups of water in the AM with 1/8 tsp of salt for electrolytes; then just black coffee or tea until noon.
* I may try longer fasts in the future depending on how all this goes.
* Trying to only drink alcohol on special occasions, like vacation or a birthday party, etc. and stick with spirits rather than wine or beer.

Seeing the weight loss is encouraging, although I look the same and my clothes fit the same, which is why I think it's water weight.

2144,This method actually works?!,"Hello everyone, I decided to actually look into IF this morning after my new coworker told me she lost 100 lbs doing 20:4 fasting over the past year. I am a person of science studying to become a PA, so I turned to academic journals to see what I could find.

[This article by some researchers at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Poland](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/3/673/htm) has more than enough evidence to convince me. I fell victim to the notion that IF was just another potientally harmful diet that could do more harm than good, but the science behind it changed my mind.

I originally lost about 25lbs after going GF (out of necessity) and eating at a 1300 kcal deficit. It wasn't that bad, but I got really sick of how annoying it is to calorie count and log all that data every day. Do you guys calorie count while you IF? Stick to a general guidlines?

**IF 20:4 M-F, 18-6 S/S**  


So I've made it nearly four months, and so far 49lbs down! First, **THANK YOU** to the many that share their successes, and more importantly, struggles. I've taken away more motivation from reading this sub than any other area, and boy have there been a few times in the last month when I needed that. It was a relatively easy and quite rapid go for a seven or so week period between month 1 and 3, and well the last 6 weeks or so has been a real doozy of mostly hovering around 285 for a month.   


I was waiting for my bloodwork from last week to come back and everything looks great except my cholesterol levels. High LDL, low HDL. Haven't had the follow-up yet, but from what I'm reading, some of that can be attributed to quite a bit of ""rapid"" weight loss, plus fasting (it was near my normal eating window time so close to 17 hours) can raise LDL as well? Either way, it might explain a few things I've been noticing lately, we'll see what the doctor says.   


Other than that, the weight loss pace has certainly slowed down, but I think that's a better place to be. I'm able to walk much farther without flinching than I have in years, my resting heart rate has dropped a good 15%, all the activity trends from my watch are trending higher, and I'm finding that while I don't exactly ""feel"" that I feel any better, I do notice that I am having much less occurrences of the ""not feeling great"" feelings of times past. That and the double chin is turning into a chin, and I can go past buttoning up an older jacket by a good 1.5"" when it previously wouldn't button up at all, and need to get a new belt and jeans size soon too.

2202,Please help with cheap meals advice,"Hi! :)

I'm Constantin. 30M, CW: 220lbs(100kg), GW: 165lbs(75kg)

TLDR: What are some simple and cheap-ish recipes I can do for a 20:4, OMAD diet, considering that I'm a truck driver, have a small fridge, no freezer and I can mostly buy cans as food won't spoil so much in them?

-- Beggining of ranting--

I'm currenlty working as a truck driver, doing Amazon deliveries in Europe, mostly during the night. (I mention this because during the day I can't sleep very well atm because of extreme heat, so that's a stress factor that increases the insulin level).

I'm just fed up looking the way I do, so I decided it's time for a change.
I've tried keto like an year ago and found it unsustainable because my hunger and cravings were really high.

Recently, I've done some 18:6 IF and in the past dew days I've done a 36h fast, a 20:4 and an OMAD. I've also cut down on alchool and sugar. White bread, potatoes and noodles still consist a big part of my daily menu.

I really love IF as opposed to keto. I've been following this community for quite a long time, so I know many incorporate keto with IF for far better results. I just cannot. I live for half an year in a truck, so can't really be cooking every day and just don't have access to a supermarket more than once a week to be able to have fresh veggies at all time. Atm it is 100F (38¬∞) outside so any vegetables would just spoil quickly.

I'm trying to get into 20:4 and omad from now on but I just don't know what to fill the gap with. Not really sure what to have for a good 1500ish calories healthy meal.
I'm hoping that you can help me fill this gap.

I've had like boiled eggs, hash browns(potatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper), white beans in tomato sauce, some kind of salad I make out of kidney beans, canned corn, canned tuna and chopped tomatoes. For meat, I've had grilled pork and grilled sausages (in a grill pan). Also, as a filler, I would just get a bowl of instant noodles. As you can see, not much I can do with what I have with me. 

Also, coffee is a must for me as a driver so I drink 2 per day, black but sweetened with 4 cyclamate based swetener pills. 

Also have canned spinach(for omlets), canned peas and canned carrots that go along with fried eggs.

Not really sure where to start to be honest. 
Trying to plan some meals for the following weeks I'm clueless where to start, so please help me with some meal advices.

Also, I use a camping gas can for cooking so I can't cook a bonw broth or anything simillar that implies a lot of cooking time.

I'm really motivated by everyone, every single day seeing your great results so I really want to make a changw and hit at least 180lbs before Christmas. 
Not to mention my future wife is with me and she weights 202lbs atm and she wants to hop in my journey :)

-- End of rant --

Also, for those recommending The Obesity Code, thank you so much! I haven't finished it yet, I'm about 2/3 into reading it, but it has opened my eyes in many ways, to the point where I don't really want to touch sugar again.

This kind of made me think about my past.

In primary school, the government has made a project in which school children were given a free bread stick and milk. That was part of their national health program. Bread stick given as being healthy? 

Also, I remember as a kid eating like 2 meals a day, one in the morning and one in the evening after I came back gome from playing soccer all day long, with no snacks, no juice in between.

We had sweets and juice in bigger quantities only on holidays. Now kids are just being fed all sort of nonsense every single day and we wonder why they're gettinf fatter and fatter, even since birth.

Me and my future wife are planning a baby in 1 or 2 yrs, so the obese children subject was quite touchy for me.

2204,IF and a low-sugar diet helped me feel better in less than a week.,"I am 41F, pretty overweight. Over the past few years my weight gain has accelerated and nothing I tried seemed to help. I love working out and lifting weight, love vegetables and fruits -- but I also love sugar and carbs. Last month I had some bloodwork done and, while they did not check my A1C, my fasting glucose was a little too high, my triglycerides were too high, and and my overall cholesterol was not great. Also my Vitamin D was a little low. 

Also for the past few years, I've had the following symptoms:

1. Feeling super shaky and headachy after working out. 
2. Pins and needles in fingers. 
3. High-ish blood pressure.
4. Tired all the time. 

And in the past few months:

1. Feeling shaky and headachy after eating in the morning and at other random times. Recently I went to an amusement park with my family and had to immediately find something to eat because I thought I was going to pass out. 
2. Tingling toes. 

My doctor did not mention diabetes or prediabetes and seemed mainly concerned about my cholesterol. But just last week, I looked hard at the results, thought hard about my symptoms, and it hit me: I probably have prediabetes. 

So I decided to act as though I actually *do* have prediabetes. Can't hurt! What to do? The plan:

1. IF 16:8 with the eventual goal of 20:4 and then possibly OMAD. This will help give my body a break from insulin production. I break my fast at 2 pm and end at 10 pm (I live in Spain and we eat later here.)
2. Very very few added sugars. A piece of fruit or two per day, OK. A square of dark chocolate, OK. But nothing more. 
3. Very little bread, rice, potatoes. A bite of potato or a few French fries, OK. But instead of tacos, make a salad with the meat. No rice with my chicken curry. Scrambled eggs and tomatoes, no toast. Etc. 
4. Every day I take chromium picolinate, Vitamin D, Calcium with magnesium, and a colon care supplement. 

In the last 5 days I've done a 16:8 eating window. I've kept my carbs under 125 grams per day and my sugars under 40 grams total, including fruit. I've eaten higher protein and higher fat, with plenty of fiber and lots of vegetables. I've eaten an average of around 1800 calories per day (again, I'm pretty overweight and that if far below my TDEE).

I haven't weighed myself, but the results so far:

1. I am much less shaky. I did HIIT training today and did not end up with a headache.
2. I have a lot more energy. I feel better. I feel ... optimistic? 
3. I don't really miss the stuff I'm not eating. There is an entire Costco bag of mini Reese's in my fridge that I have not touched. I have said no to ice cream, macarons, gummy candy, rice, and all manner of bread. It's been fine. It helps that I feel so much better. 
4. I get hungry but not ravenously, uncontrollably hungry. Clearly not having blood sugar spikes and crashes the same way. 

Anyway. I just want to say that IF+lower-carb/higher vegetable is working for me so far, and I'm grateful for it. 

I got back to the doctor in a few months and am hopeful my bloodwork will look much better then.",intermittentfasting,1657104557

2241,Alternative day fast focus questions," Hello to everyone I attempted to find a post similar to what I am posting but I've really never used reddit so this may be redundant. I bet there are a lot of educated individuals here so I would greatly appreciate your feedback and if possible I would love to check references. I have been searching for months how fast does metabolism adapt to calorie restriction. I've found conflicting information stating that starvation mode is not significant to Dr. Fung stating that your body can adapt to severe calorie reduction and kill losses quite quickly. Is this diet dependent? Meaning can someone in deep keto not care about calorie reduction because different comes from fat. If so are there studies showing when does calorie restriction start to become an issue. I wonder about this because a lot of people recommend 25% calorie reduction on keto but if it's not an issue why not go for 50% by supplementing with fiber to prevent hunger. I know calorie restriction in western diet can become an issue but how many days does it take to become an issue. I am attempting to do an alternative day fast because I think it would be extremely powerful at healing me and help me loose weight. Nonetheless, I've seen people do 500 calories on their fasting days and can't help to wonder if this over time would have an effect on their BMR. I will certainly shoot for not eating anything in my fasting days and although I'm not a newbie at fasting, I've never attempted to fast so often and can predict that at some point I will try to eat if even a little on my fasting days.

I (27M) used to work a very active job until my dad got sick and I needed to work remotely and with a predictable schedule to be able to help with that. I've struggled with my weight my entire life, and have decided to commit to IF since it's the only thing I've had marginal success with.  


I'm currently hovering just over 300lbs (6') and and am pretty widely set to begin with. My goal is 200lbs, and I'd be fine pushing pretty hard to get there. I lift a couple times a week and go on the occasional walk, and frankly don't have the energy with everything going on to expand that too much.   


My current thought is to eat normally for an hour and fast the rest of each day. I usually eat pretty average macros and don't indulge in sweets much, though I have been known to drink spirits on occasion.   


 \- Does that seem reasonable/like a suitable choice?

 \- Should I make dietary changes? More meat/veg relative to carbs?

 \- Is there a specific hour which has maximal impact?

 \- Should I add a day or two a week where I don't eat anything?

2273,"38M 16:8 CICO SW: 295, CW: 255, GW: 175. NON SCALE VICTORY","So I wanted to share a personal NSV with you guys while it is still fresh in my mind.   I started walking 4+ days a week when I started my IF program in May.   In August, I picked it up to 7 days a week, generally first thing in the morning.   I do a course around my neighborhood and local area, which ends up clocking in at about 3 miles.   My average times and session HR have been creeping down since the beginning.  Parts of the walk that used to be harder, are now much easier on my body.   This is a combination of 40 less pounds, and a whole lot of work on my cardio fitness.

Today I just decided to go for it, and try to set a new Personal Best average mile.   I went in with the attitude of just pushing myself as hard as I could for the whole session.   I jogged for longer periods of time than I ever had, and really pushed myself on the hills, keeping my HR up for the whole session.   By the end, I had set a new PB average mile time of 13'31"" down from 14""11, an improvement of 40 seconds.   

When I started this process, my average mile times were closer to 17 minutes.   So over 5 months of working at it, I brought my average time down almost 3 and a half minutes per mile.   It may not sound like much, but to me, this is the biggest NSV I have seen so far, and something that just has me glowing.",intermittentfasting,1662731768
2279,"One week of 20:4, Waistline reduced by 3.5cm :)","Hi everyone! I've been reading this subreddit for a really long time, and last month I finally determined to start fasting *again*, after gaining a lot of weight due to work-related stress.

SW79, CW75, GW60

I started doing 16:8 IF in mid-August, and I lost 3 cm in my waistline (96cm to 93cm) in 3 weeks.

Recently I started 20:4 and found that it isn't that bad. I ate between 4pm and 8pm. I usually broke my fast with hard boil eggs, broccoli/green vegetables, some cheese, and a handful of nuts. Then I had dinner with my family- it's the meal that we enjoy together as it's essential that we still eat as a family together! I didn't restrict what I eat for dinner but I am very conscious about sugar intake and say no to desserts.

Just a week of 20:4, I found that I lost another 3cm in my waistline (93cm to 90cm). Weight-wise the drop is steady but I understand that much is water weight and what I read on the scale could be fluctuating. 

I also start tracking my hunger waves to see if there's any pattern. I didn't do 'clean' water fast during my fasting period. I follow Dr Jason Fung's advice. I had black coffee (with a splash of milk) and tea (also with a splash of milk) when I experience hunger. I have stomach issues so I can't really have cider vinegar on an empty stomach (and not a big fan of its taste).

I walked 8k steps every day, 5 days a week. I didn't do a lot of exercise but I start doing some resistance band training at home, 15-30 minutes every other day. I know adding exercise will be useful but I just haven't figured out how to do that in my everyday work schedule yet.

I'm hopeful that 20:4 could be a realistic and sustainable lifestyle. Hope I'll come back later with more positive updates. 

Lastly just want to say that reading all the posts in this subreddit really gives me hope and motivation to carryon. Thanks for all your generous sharing

2283,How was your first week of IF? Share your struggles!,"Today is the 5th day of my 16:8 IF! And I must say, it has already been quite a rollercoaster. 

I've always been a breakfast person, but now with a new job it got pretty inconvenient, since I have to get up at 6 every day to manage my usual heavy breakfast preparation, and it's just so not worth it... So I stumbled upon intermittent fasting and jumped straight into it. My plan is to have my lunch at around 12, which fits my working schedule perfectly, have some snack at around 4, and then try to manage my last meal at 6-7. 

First 2 days went pretty good, although i was extremely hungry in the mornings. At 10:30-11 I was starting to watch pictures of food on the internet and dream of a lunch break. But I also kinda found joy in this struggle, and noticed that i'm way more sharp and concentrated when hungry. 

Then on the 3d day I had weird nausea in the morning, and even had to lay down for a bit before leaving the house. It went away, but I ended up breaking my fast with a cinnamon bun and a cupcake late at night because my friend came to visit me and brought the food, and for some I reason I didn't want to say that I'm fasting, expecting questions or judgment. By the way, how do you deal with such situations when you are offered food by your friends or family, and you just feel weird telling them about your eating schedule?

But yeah, I tried not to stress too much about it, telling myself that I'm just a beginner and my body is getting adapted, and continued on the 4th day as before. And this time I got a severe hunger at around 6-7, and ended up eating the whole fridge, mixing food in weird combinations. I did it in the meal window, but I really was feeling physically uncomfortable from the amount of food I stuffed my body with...

And today, on the 5th day, I woke up slightly nauseous again, but at least not hungry. I'm motivated to continue, but I really don't want these evening cravings to repeat. I guess it means that I was not having enough calories during the day, but I will need to figure out how to fit bigger/more nutritious meals in my schedule, because I'm at my workplace from 9 until 6, and then I usually try to go to the gym or meet friends, so basically all I can eat is what I bring with me or what I buy in the cafeteria. I'm working in the fucking middle of nowhere, so there are no shops or diners nearby.

As I said, I'm really motivated to keep going, and I understand that my body needs time to adjust. But I have to yet figure out so much, so it get's frustrating from time to time...

However it's a problem for me on two counts, both socially and nutritionally. For the first, I don't go out a lot but I do with some regularity and often I could see dinner starting or at least continuing Beyond a strict 8 p.m. cutoff. On the other hand, I like to work out and get started with my day very early, and needing to wait until 12 seems like it would leave me a bit lethargic, and also be a problem since I'm likely to be busy then.

I am in good shape and and get a good amount of activity and exercise, is the strict 12/8 IF schedule really going to be advantageous for me, or can I do something loser?

I do enjoy the feeling and energy, and  mental clarity, of feeling less full and being a little hungry occasionally. Currently I do essentially ""1.5MAD"" - some fruit, nut, yogurt/kefir/diary protein in the morning (~7-8), main meal ~6-7:30).

Other days = 2x meals in 20/4 window. These are lunch (1-2pm) and dinner (5-6pm). 

My meals are fairly sensible, but not extreme dieting - e.g. evening meals are around 600 to 800 calories with large quantities of vegetables. Lunches are similar. 

I'm 6'1"" male and I estimate my weight to have been 16 stone / 224 lbs (UK) at the start of the diet. I've not weighed myself because I've previously got obsessed and disheartened by constanty weighing myself during my previous weight loss plans.

In LBS: SW: 290 CW: 256.1 GW: 160

In KG: SW: 131 CW: 116 GW: 70

[I've included a graph of daily weigh-ins this month.](https://i.imgur.com/WGjlBCs.png) I was interested in the data. I had a good start but towards the end there was a struggle to crack past 256. It's interesting to see the fluctuations in the month, though, but it serves as a reminder that progress is being made, you just have to see the big picture. 

So, what did I eat this month? Here is a sampling:

* [Salmon, rice, broccoli drizzled with some eel sauce](https://i.imgur.com/wlzQY0m.jpg)
* [Shrimp primevera and angel hair pasta](https://i.imgur.com/tZ5HoY1.jpg)

* [For dessert one night had peanut butter crunch granola, a banana and some biscoff cookie butter](https://i.imgur.com/dgU3yGb.jpg)

Most nights I would have a dessert; a square of a homemade brownies that I keep in the freezer and pull one out when I want one to thaw. Some days I would do 2MAD, but for lunch it consisted of tuna and crackers when I felt like I needed it. As you can see, my vegetable range is very small, but what I do eat I *really* enjoy so I don't get too tired of them. I wasn't a big fan of the green beans, but that's ok, at least I tried them. 

I'm not *actively* doing super low carb, but I try and get low carb items where I can, such as with tortillas and my quest for a low carb pizza crust. Highly reccomend the chicken pizza crust:

* 10 oz Canned Chicken
* 28g (or a service size of your brand) grated parmesan cheese
* 1 Egg

Dry your chicken out as much as possible before mixing, especially if you're getting it from a can, but you can use fresh shredded chicken. Mix that all together and spread the mixture into a crust on parchment paper. 375 degree oven for about 12-15 minutes or until desired crisp level, flip it over optionally for the other side a couple minutes. It's very delicious and has great texture and structure.

Didn't do too many full day fasts this month, I'll be incorporating more of them for September. 

I've also signed up for a 5k that'll be happening November 24th, the Turkey Trot! It'll be my first 5k and race outside of something virtual. I had to rest my leg for a few weeks this month but I'm slowly ramping in the exercise again starting this week.

2373,"I'm sick of how I look, I want to be better, but I am scared","TW ED

I have a complicated history with ED, in the sense that I've tried to force myself to have one in the past (in middle school, I'm nearly 30 now) but gave up because I knew it was wrong and hated the way it felt, and I have been surrounded by them and I hate seeing the people I love battle them. I don't want to put my loved ones through that, they are on heightened awareness as far as signs and what they look like, and I'm concerned about doing this right.

I hate the way I look, I always have, I tried keto for a while a few years ago and it seemed to be the only thing that worked for me but I am now sick of how food rules my life. I don't like the feeling of being hungry and now I've even started to feel sick instead of hungry because I just don't want to eat as much. I feel like my entire life schedule revolves around eating. I wake up for breakfast, I stop working for lunch, all of my dates are ""let's go eat"", my first conversation with my roommate is always what we want for dinner, I don't want my life to revolve around food. I want to enjoy food again and I want to lose weight, I'm tired of always eating and I want to try IF but I want to do it the right way and I'm not sure how to go about it.

I don't want to set off any alarms for my family and friends who are no strangers to ED and are also all very food oriented. I want to start but I want to be educated on what the best way to do this is. I can and have read up on it but I would rather hear real life experiences from people with this lifestyle, from you.

I started to exercise via Ring Fit roughly around the same time I started IF last year. I have a weak knee, so I only do light exercises a few times a week.

Started on around difficult level 5 - it was already hard and I became breathless fast. I also tried to avoid exercises that would put too much pressure on my knees (unless I really need it to pass a level).

A year later and with the help of fasting, my body can move better and faster. My knee still hurts, but I can do squats and mountain climbs as long as I move carefully. I've finished the main adventure part of the game and I'm leveling up in the extra worlds. Also changed the settings so I had to finish all sets of the exercise before moving to the next parts. 

I've progressively increased the difficulty levels whenever I feel like the sets have become ""easy"" to finish. Right now, I'm on level 12 - more than twice my level last year. I'm so so happy about this. I used to think that I can only do slow exercises like yoga, but I'm really enjoying the fast paced movements of Ring Fit.

2418,Pleasantly surprised at how relatively easy 24 hour fasts have been,"I've been on and off using IF for a handful of years now, but only simple 18:6 or 20:4 windows and nothing more. I saw good results last time but I admittedly kinda fell off the wagon. In that time, I changed jobs from physical labor to a desk job and I gained almost 30 lbs to reach the heaviest I've ever weighed, 207 lbs.

Recently, I've adjusted to a slightly different routine of 16:8 on the weekdays but kinda OMAD where I'll have a protein bar at lunch and then get the rest of my calories for the day (at a slight defecit) all at dinnertime. On Saturday I'll have my cheat day where I won't go too crazy but largely won't care what I eat. Then on Sunday I stop eating at noon so I can begin a 24 hour fast that ends right at lunchtime to eat my protein bar for lunch on Monday.

I was a bit intimidated to do a routine 24 hour fast. I've done it before as part of a fundraiser back in highschool, and I distinctly remember being miserable (though I was also an athlete, which made practice quite tough). However these last 5 weeks I've been pleasantly surprised! The 24 hour fast being (mostly) over by the time I wake up for work has been pretty helpful for me, where I can just grind my work out for a few hours then I can eat again! I must say, the hardest part is Sunday evening, especially since I am a recreational weed user, and the munchies hit so hard on Sunday evenings haha. 

I started the IF (without the 24 hour fast) about two months ago and added in the weekly 24 just over a month ago, and I'm down 14 lbs to 193! I have an end goal in mind somewhere around 175 or so, and this has been really encouraging progress!",intermittentfasting,1662494264

2422,Looking for studies/explanation,"Hi, I started a form of intermittent fasting where I skip breakfast and eat a meal around 3 pm if possible and dinner b/w 6 - 8 pm. 

The reason I did is because I'm in class/working until 2:30 pm anyway and dont get a chance to eat. + if I eat in the noon, I get really, incredibly sleepy at work/class. 

I've been drinking green tea in the morning with a small toast for a little over a week. this has helped my digestive system and also helped me not be so hungry throughout the day.

2435,Newbie here. I want to use IF for cutting after bulking.,"Hello. sorry if my English is bad. I have a question on losing weight. And I need to do it fast for I joined a December weight contest. so for background. I have 5 months on lifting on the gym. My weight before was 110 klg(242lbs) now it's 73klg(160lbs). I have loss that since I stop eating more, less sugar, hitting the gym and then with my active work. now my body gained muscles and can lift 550 lbs in leg press. My goal for this year until the year end is to have at least a shredded body or beach body for the weight contest. now my question is...

&amp;#x200B;

* Is IF good in losing weight  (I have chubby fat) and maintaining/growth for my muscles? 
* how do I do IF for cutting?

**body background:**

*  73klg (160lbs) 
* 5'5 height
* 24 years old
* my diet always have rice on it. since I'm from an Asian country. We love rice in my country.
* gained muscles but need diet for losing fat.
* I did dirty bulking then clean bulking for 3 months.

**Why I want to lose weight?**

* I joined a December **Body Contest**, December 24, 2022. So 4 months to go.
* My goal at least shredded, cut, or beach body.

**Why did you choose Intermittent Fasting?**

* My first choice is actually ***Macro diet*** to cut but I don't want to measure my intake because...
* **November and December** is near. And I'm a busy dude, I always go to parties especially holidays. that is why I choose IF so that I could enjoy the food during the holidays.
* And if I do **Macro diet i'll fucking ruined it** because holiday!

**Do you have experience in IF before?**

* yes! I did for 2 months. 1 month for eating a lot of clean food I cook my meal. eggs. and bought protein shake rule 1 since that what I can afford (not a mass protein). 
* Then the the last month is experimenting on 20/4, 22/2, and 1 day eat 1 day fast.
* This month  September 1 to 6. I want to try eating less and then fasting. man, it ruined my performance during workout. then always hungry. 

**What is your goal after the contest?** 

* **Bulk!** maybe clean bulk or I'll try IF again with 3000+ calorie a day.  16 fast/8 feast. after cutting.
* I need to bulk since I need to gain muscles.

**Why ask help here?**

* I want the community support and maybe I'll be a great model if I pull this off. So please help me :pray:.
* I need stranger audience I'll show my progress here. 

So any question I need to entertain. pls do, I want to grow big and strong using this IF diet method. cause I fuckin love good clean food.

No one noticed or even said anything to me about my weight loss for almost 60 days!! So don‚Äôt give up. My husband and in-laws who live with us STILL haven‚Äôt said a word.

SW: 193 on July 5, 2022
CW: 180 on September 1, 2022
GW: my pre-baby lifelong baseline of 135. I‚Äôm giving myself plenty of time to get back there, probably another 7 months. (April 2023) 
I think that‚Äôs a rational time frame.

1. Before starting fasting, I took 2 full weeks to get fully adapted to a healthy ketogenic food regimen and increased my daily water intake to 100 ounces a day spread out. (I now drink even more). This was the key to not getting any bad effects when beginning fasting. Over 2 weeks I gradually lowered my daily carbohydrates to 25 per day or less. (Carbohydrates and sugar are not advised when fasting because they make your fasting time really difficult.) During this time, I listened to the audio book ‚ÄúThe Complete Guide to Fasting‚Äù by Dr. Jason Fung and I still listen to it almost daily and learn new things. 

2. I am keeping strictly to a clean, whole food based low carbohydrate food intake that includes lots of low carbohydrate veggies and plan to continue eating this way for the rest of my life with few exceptions. 

3. Even with no cheat days I didn‚Äôt see any results from IF (16:8) for my first 40 days and almost gave up! Even when keeping track of my macros on a ketogenic food intake, the scale wasn‚Äôt moving, BUT, my body composition was changing (getting smaller). I have a lot of weight to lose (80lbs total) and realized that for me, 16:8 is really more of a maintenance regimen. So, at my 40 day mark I decided to add two 24 hour fasts per week Weds / Sun to see what happened. It worked! My weight loss started. 

4. I am eating 1600 to 1800 calories daily. 70% fat, 20% protein, and 10% carbohydrates. I own and use a food scale and I read labels before eating or buying food. I am avoiding food in packages. 

5. My biggest success so far has come from doing 20:4, plus, adding longer fasts in between days of eating normally (2 meals about 800 calories each, spaced 4 hours apart, at 2:30pm and 6:30pm).  I visibly see a difference right away. 

6. Don‚Äôt rely on the other people around you to say anything or give you compliments. No one noticed or even said anything to me about my weight loss for almost 60 days!! A coworker I‚Äôve known since before I got pregnant and during my pregnancy finally walked up to me last Thursday and said, ‚Äúhello my skinny friend, what have you been doing, you are losing weight!‚Äù Your motivation needs to come from inside YOU.

7. I feel like crap if I get dehydrated. Our kidneys and liver are the workhorse of fat loss (lipolysis). Do everything you can to take great care of your body while fasting. Water water water! Electrolytes. NO ALCOHOL. It stops all the good things that are happening in your body from fasting. If this idea of no alcohol is making you feel uncomfortable, please assess your relationship with drinking. 

8. I don‚Äôt weigh in daily. I do ‚Äúweigh In Wednesdays‚Äù in the early morning after potty time to keep track. 

9. The scale fluctuates, some weeks backwards if I eat too much salt. Don‚Äôt stress. I remind myself it‚Äôs a marathon not a race. If the trend is going generally downward then it‚Äôs all good.

10. I have found the inexpensive supplements Myo-Inositol (4g, split into 2g doses 8 hours apart) Chromium Picolinate (100mg 2x day), Berberine (500mg 3x/day) and especially Acetyl-L-Carnitine (1000mg 2x day) helpful to stabilize blood sugar and ward off feelings of anxiety about not eating.

Thanks in advance!",intermittentfasting,1662389420
2486,Question about alcohol,"Of course I realize everyone‚Äôs different but I‚Äôm curious if this situation seems familiar to anyone. For the last year and a half I‚Äôve been pretty good about intermittent fasting. I definitely take a break now and again, typically in the form of a shortened fast, and while I‚Äôve had a couple of longer fasts I have not been very extreme. I‚Äôve been really good about water intake and for the last few months my diet has been a lot better‚Ä¶ Much more on fruit and vegetable, significant decrease in sugars and processed carbs etc.

So here‚Äôs my problem ‚Äì Alcohol consumption. This has happened twice in the last few weeks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be with a friend, I‚Äôll have two drinks of red wine and feel pretty good. Sometimes I can sneak a third glass in, which would always happen over dinner, but even with food I‚Äôve been waking up the next morning feeling really bad. No headache, but my stomach is upset and I have zero energy.

2492,I think IF is affecting my relationship,"So like 6wks? ago my wife started doing IF, with the goal of losing weight so she looks good for an event we have at the end of the year.
She's lost around 14kg and I'm very proud of her and the effort she's putting in, but im worried.

At first it was 16:8, then it was 20:4 and now she's doing OMAD except for the few days where she ""challenges"" herself to go without eating for 48hr intervals.
Yes she's losing fat but she's losing vital muscle too, which is extra concerning as she has unidentified growth in her lower back that her doctor specifically told her to build muscle to support in case it needs to be removed.

She's perpetually in a bad mood, short tempered, tired. She's now saying she is looking to change her job at work because she ""wants change"". Now that's a huge thing that IMO needs discussing as a family bc I only work 1x/wk because we don't have daycare available to us. We play a lot of video games together and her tolerance for mine and friends errors or losing in general has all but disappeared to be replaced by frustration. 
When it comes to her actual meals, I've started a meal box so i can build a collection of healthy, filling recipes bc I need to lose weight too. But she never eats them. She always says she wants her meals to be ""worth the wait"", so they have to be something really delicious and filling. Apparently this means lots of takeaway. So even when she does eat it's garbage like 70% of the time. Plus we're both pretty much sedentary aside from taking our daughter out.

I don't know what to do, what to say to her, but she seems to just be in a bad mood constantly, I feel miserable, we're fighting all the time and i can see our nearly 2yo daughter misses her mum just.. being mum.",intermittentfasting,1662363360

2531,38 pounds dropped in 105 days (3.5 months.) How to maintain now?,"M/49 . CW 199 . SW 237. GW 199 . Working from home. 

**Part 1**.  How I lost it. 

**Part 2**. My Question; ""How Do I Maintain This?""

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 1** : I am basically lazy. I don't do diets. That was never my original plan. I wanted something easy and 'lazy proof.' So when I ran across the idea of IF, I decided to give it a try. That was all I was willing to do. 

So my wife and I set out together on IF and restricted our eating to the hours of noon through 8pm. At first, it did seem hard. But after about a week, it was doable. In fact, after about 3 weeks, I had lost 10 pounds. 

However, my body and eating habits adjusted. I was at a wall and and not losing anymore after the first 10 pounds. I noticed that I was binge eating for my first meal because I was so hungry. So the next change I made was to **not** allow real food until 1pm, but at noon I was allowed to have a protein shake. I don't know if this helped or not but it did stop me from binge eating. 

But after some time with no further weight loss, I consulted the people on this board as to what my next step should be. The answer that was given the most was that I needed to count calories and limit my intake. My thoughts on that were, ""Hell no."" I am not a calorie counter and that was not something I signed up for. I am a lazy ass dieter. 

So the second most suggested option was that I cut out carbs from my diet or go low carb. So I decided to apply a rule that if the net carbs per serving was 5 grams or less, I could eat it. Otherwise, **no**. Net grams were calculated by subtracting the fiber grams from the carbohydrate grams. It was extremely difficult. I missed potato chips, crackers, and most of all Popcorn. But it **was** working. This new plan got my weight loss started again. 

However, once again, my body adjusted. After a few months I was yet again not losing weight. I don't know when or why exactly my outlook changed on counting calories. Maybe it was because I took small steps to get there. Maybe it was because I had so much invested already. But I got a notepad and kept it in the kitchen with a pencil next to it at all times. I reluctantly began tracking my calories. At first I was  at 1500 per day. As I got better at tracking the calories more precisely, I did lower that down to 1000 to 1200 calories per day. I am aware that is on the very low end of safe, or maybe not safe at all. I do NOT recommend this to others, but it was not producing any side effects that I could see for myself. I was eating mostly protein but getting vitamins and nutrients from some fruits and vegetables, plus the protein shakes (Costco has the most choices!) 

These steps got me all the way down to 201. So close to my goal. So close that I even allowed myself a serving of popcorn once. However, about a week ago, I noticed my weight was stuck again. I had been at or around 201/202 for several weeks. Once again, I consulted this group. The responses were all over the place. The most common response was that my caloric intake was way too low. There were a few that suggested I lower it even more . But the responses that seemed best to me were suggesting I up my physical exercise. I decided I would give myself 2-3 days of the same low caloric intake but run a mile each night. If it didn't work after 3 days to lose the last 2-3 pounds, my plan would have been to continue the exercise but increase my calories by about 300 daily. However, after just 2 nights, I had hit my goal weight. 

Probably the most important thing I learned is that you just have to start somewhere. At the start, I though t there was no way in hell I was counting calories, cutting carbs, or  running. Not my lazy ass. But I didn't have to do all that right away. I just had to **do something**, anything. The start that I chose was IF. Step by step, that lead to me adding other little parts until next thing I knew I was in full fledged bad ass dieter mode.

The second most important thing I learned was that you have to keep adjusting. You cant just have a plan and stick with it and expect it to work. Your body will adjust, so you have to keep throwing it for a loop. When you hit a wall, add a new component. Change anything, and keep on pushing. 

Lastly, If you have   relapse, don't let it make you quit. My popcorn day was probably more than one serving to be honest (and I use a lot of oil.)  I had a bad weigh in the next morning. I was so close that I could have stopped. I'm glad I forgot about that and kept on going. 

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2**  : So... now what? My plan now is to maintain 2000 daily calories and continue the IF. I will also keep starting with the protein shake at noon to prevent binging. But I can eat carbs now and there will be no other dietary restrictions. Hello popcorn!  I am going back to light exercise or whatever I happen to get that week based on my schedule. I will not weigh myself daily. I will  weigh myself maybe once a week or once every other week. 

**Does anyone else have any suggestions on how to maintain this new weight?**

I'll also drink black coffee during my fast, usually a couple of cups - sometimes 3 but no more.  I do have a tendency to overdo coffee and so I try and never go past 3 cups.

Tea - I might have 1-2 cups of regular tea during a fast (black, nothing added)

2536,WHY does constipation happen with IF?,"TL;DR: Why does IF result in constipation for some people (**looking for specific, science-based explanations for how the body/gut adjusts to IF**)? Does eating breakfast at different times once in a while (while still fasting at least 16 hours and within a two hour window still later than a ""normal"" breakfast time) hinder the body's adjustment to IF? Have you experienced this and did you get through it?

I'm currently experiencing the irregularity that I now know is pretty common when beginning IF. For some background, I've been practicing IF for 46 days now with a handful cheat days/shorter fasts in between, but mostly a mix of 18:6 and 16:8 (I'm very consistent on weekdays, weekends will get me sometimes). 

I've read almost all of the posts on here about constipation, new and old, as well as done my fair share of googling, so I've heard every bit of advice out there and I don't need any recommendations to eat fiber/take magnesium/eat prunes, etc. I know that these things produce laxative effects, but before IF my digestion was like clockwork and I'd like it to work naturally again (although I did up my fiber intake and have used many of these methods to relieve discomfort). Sometimes I'll feel like I'm getting somewhere and like my insides are finally on board with the program, but each week I seem to end up with this issue again.

I talk to my partner about the ups and downs of IF and he expresses concern about this, because **if IF is so healthy and makes me feel good otherwise, then why is this happening?** 

I see what he means and dealing with this issue is making me rethink IF. What I want to know is *why* this happens, so I can justify continuing this practice. I know that the body and gut need to adjust, but could anyone give me some more **specific** information as to what exactly is adjusting? 

Sometimes I'll eat breakfast earlier (only by two hours max unless it's a cheat day) usually because I was doing 18:6 and switched to 16:8 because of extreme tiredness/hunger and because my goal is just to fast at least 16 hours every day - is this making it worse? Is a cheat day on the weekend (including alcohol) throwing a wrench in my gut's adjustment?

Thank you to everyone who responds to this with as much details as you can, I really appreciate it. When I first started IF (before this issue started), I felt like it was meant for me. I had always struggled a lot with eating breakfast and my life is so much simpler now that I don't, so I really don't want to give it up. However, if I can't figure this out or at least understand why it's happening, I'm afraid I'll have to throw in the towel.

59F, SW TBD :-)  GW - whatever I can get to is progress.

Background:

I have Hashimoto and (obv) hit menopause - double whammy for weight issues. Was always a healthy eater (no sugar,soda, alcohol, junk, mostly veggies and fruits) but the weight crept up and I could never stick to diets that restricted certain food groups. I tried to work off the excess weight and also saw a nutritionist but couldn't achieve significant change.  To make things worse, I tore my ACL two years ago and by the time I was ready to go back to working out, they closed the pools (I swim). 

Current plan:

Inspired by many of you who posted about your experience and progress (much gratitude!) I started IF about 4 weeks ago. It's definitely something I can do! Started with 16/8, by now doing mostly 17/7 or 18/6 every day. I am not counting calories and don't really intend to, unless I really have to. Having received both my shots, I'm also back in the pool. Took a slow start, but will be up to 50 minutes/5 days/week starting next week. I consider these last couple of weeks just a warm up and my official start date will be 05/01.  I plan on posting once a months to journal my progress and to keep myself on track.

44F, 5'2"", SW 212, CW 186, GW 135ish.  Fasting for weight loss, and to keep down LDL and BP, which are starting to creep up.

I tried to many things at once, which resulted in a crash and burn.  I gave up all sugar, went OMAD with some ADF and a couple of EF thrown in, totally clean water fasts.  And it was too much at once.

Started over.  Decided to get the basics down first.  20/4, with a cup of coffee with a splash of HWC in the morning to tide me over.  Week one, my eating window was 12-4.  Week two, it was 1-5.  I'm in week three now, eating between 2-6.  I think my body is used to not eating in the morning now, and I can add another element.

What do you recommend my next be?

* Give up the coffee/HWC during my fast (I would replace with a 100mg caffeine pill, until I can wean entirely off caffeine.)

* Shorten eating window to 23/1 or OMAD

* Throw in an 36 hr fast once or twice a week

* Cut sugar/carbs further

2. Can I be flexible with my 16:8? For example on Monday have eating window 9 am - 17 pm and on Tuesday have eating window 10 am - 18 pm?

When would you eat your one meal?

Would it be better to just do something like a 22:2 so you can eat a bit more instinctively and have a snack?

And can you workout a bit doing OMAD?  I like doing 30-60 mins of cardio whenever I can fit it in.

However, the scale hasn't moved in 14 days. Yesterday was my birthday, and I did great all day planning all my meals. We went for dinner, and I had to make a change last minute that caused me to have a total of 24 carbs for the day.  Not the end of the world. Since I am trying to make this a lifestyle, I have to allow some leeway once in a while for life, right?  That means going over carbs once in a while and then getting back to it. So as a special birthday treat I also had a homemade cookie. No idea how many carbs there were, and I don't care. I knew that I was going to get right back to eating IF and keto today. 

So there is a FB community that I am part of that has been pretty supportive or so I thought. I posted about my day on there just to say how different this was from last year when I didn't care about what I was putting in my mouth. Back then the day would have consisted of many sweet coffee drinks, several big meals, lots of bread, and probably sweets throughout the day.  This year I was on track all day and had one sweet treat, and even though I wasn't perfect, it was an improvement.  Not just nutritionally, but also mentally. In the past, I would have basically just given up with an 'all or nothing' attitude and quit all together. Well, the admins decided it wasn't acceptable for me to tell other members that I was ok with my choices.  So I'm sitting here all salty about it.

However I haven‚Äôt lost any weight so far and I‚Äôm getting quite frustrated. I‚Äôm shocked, because before starting IF my diet was absolutely abysmal.

At home, we‚Äôd order out constantly, I‚Äôd have an entire bag of Cheetos or other chips as a snack, and in general just ate like a 5 year old.

I‚Äôve completely stopped the fast food, and we are only eating meals cooked at home. So we are eating fairly balanced meals now and I‚Äôm eating honestly 1/3 of what I used to, and I‚Äôm feeling like I have way more power and control over my bad relationship with food. One of my meals was a bunless cheeseburger with green beans for example. Earlier was cauliflower and sweet potato rice with bacon.

This has made me become miserable, IF is such a easy and amazing way to lose weight and I feel like my personal issues are stopping me from fully utilises it. Restricting my food intake alot if so hard but I am also addicted to losing weight so it just feels like a lose lose situation. Adding on to that I feel in such a mental rut atm that exercising feels seriously impossible. Aswell as that IF kind of makes it so that I don't have enough energy for any physical activity, just enough sit around and do my work.

It wasn't working. Or at least not fast enough.

But, with the fact that I'm severely obese for my age/height, I'm not overly concerned. 


Here's the thing though. I've been living at home to pay off my student debt and save up money for a down-payment on a house. And I never really explained to my mum that I was doing intermittent fasting. I just told her I wasn't going to be eating breakfast anymore (I've always had issues finding things I wanted to eat, so it was easy to explain away by being ""irritated"" at breakfast). 


However, even just cutting out breakfast and eating lunch late, my mom is always saying that I'm ""starving myself"". And that was on 16:8. She gone for a couple of weeks to help with my sibling who just had their first child. And that's when I started trying 20:4, and LOVE it and, well, progress is starting to happen.

2794,Checking in at my 6-month mark. Progress report.,"53 year-old guy. Today is six months to the day since I started intermittant fasting. Last time I wrote, I was nearly a month into IF and was frustrated because I had seen zero effect. That is no longer the case.

Recap: back in the fall I realized that I was starting down the road to a ""Dad Bod"". I felt my gut getting soft, my old jeans were noticably tighter, and the scale shocked me when it showed over 200 pounds for the first time in my life. I'm former military, very active, and never gave my weight a thought since I'd been basically the same size/shape since I was 20 years old. Until it hit me suddenly last year. I decided the give 16:8 a try.

I picked fasting hours of 7PM to 11AM and that has worked out well. After a bumpy start, I adapted to the eating schedule, and now I'm usually not overly tempted to eat before 11AM. When that time arrives and my watch beeps, I look at it as giving myself a reward. It's only difficult when I swim laps or bang out an elliptical session early in the morning, and have to wait another hour or two to eat.

Meals from 11AM to 7PM are sensible and if there is snacking in between, it's some popcorn or fruit. I didn't sacrifice any type of food, but I found early on that my portion sizes went way down. I just couldn't eat A LOT, even though I wanted to because I was hungry. I'd get painfully full pretty quickly after maybe half of the amount I would usually eat. It's an interesting side effect.

OK...the benefit. September 25th, the day I started, I was 203.0 pounds (I'm six feet tall). For four straight weeks, the scale never moved down, it even went up a bit. I was getting discouraged because I was sticking diligently to the program, FEELING many changes, but zero weight loss. Then it started slowly happening. The decimal points started going down, then entire pounds, and today (March 31) I am at 192.5.

I realize it's only ten and a half pounds, but the difference is visible, my gut and love handles have reversed course, and my jeans fit the way they did before. My wife says it's noticeable, too. (Even without my prompting her...haha) But there's another difference, which is more interesting to me than the relatively small weight loss: I feel better, maybe better than I have felt in ten years. I think I'm sleeping better, I wake up more alert, and I just feel tighter and cleaner and leaner, maybe because I'm not starting the day with a bunch of bread or sweets or heavy carbs (I used to eat oatmeal or granola cereal for early breakfast) and I can't see myself ever snacking at night again. I realized that made me feel very sluggish.

This is a long essay, apologies, but this community is the only place I can go on and on like this. I like to read about everyone's experiences in here, and I plan to keep at it and drop another ten pounds.

My advice to people who feel frustrated: **don't give up**. It eventually DOES start working, but it can be slow. Stay with it. And don't think of the eating window as some strict rigid schedule you're bound to, or as a punishment.  Look at it as a treat to yourself for sticking it out another day. It's how I quit smoking many years ago: every day that you don't slip is a tiny victory, and you're that tiny bit better a person for having accomplished it.

Before long, you can't remember the way it used to be. You've done something positive for yourself and it feels good. Don't quit.",intermittentfasting,1617243497

2799,Feeling really despairing tonight and need some encouragement,"Flaring as rant cuz I don't know what else to flair as. I've posted a couple times here already but basically started IF last Tuesday so basically a week ago. I immediately lost about 5lb which I know is mostly water weight. I'm trying to be loose about calorie counting, but also know I've been maintaining my current weight on an absolute shit diet for more than 6 months, so figure that by just making my meals smaller, eating healthier, and cutting out the sweets I should be able to lose some weight without getting anal about calorie counting (though I am roughly counting). 

I got strep Saturday and was sick in bed Sunday and Monday only able to consume liquids and soft food like yogurt and definitely ate a lot less. Ate solid food on Tuesday and absolutely indulged on a fast food fish sandwich because I had started trying to fast again (didn't while I had strep) and my window was about to run out so I acted quick. I'm on an antibiotic that luckily needs to be taken on an empty stomach (penicillin VK) so it works well for fasting, but I feel like it's making my stomach feel almost like it's burning or something. I was so hungry all day today, too. Even during my window when I could eat I just couldn't stop feeling hungry. At the same time, despite not eating much for the last few days (barring my fish sandwich yesterday), I haven't lost anymore weight and feel horrible bloated. 

Anyways, I'm trying to fast 20 hours because I am so frustrated by not seeing any more progress and I'm hungry even though I had a really delicious protein/fat filled dinner, and just feel generally very very miserable. All I want to do is eat some comfort food but also know that my body is not really hungry because I've consumed somewhere between 1500-1700 calories today (my tdee is 2100 and I emptied the rest of a storage unit today so I'm sure I burned calories). 

Anyways don't know what to do. Made myself some coffee because I splurged on a bag of imported korean coffee today and that's making me feel slightly better, but I'm so worried I'm going to keep feeling this way and for nothing if I'm not even losing any weight. At the same time terrified to stop if I gain the 5lb back which I surely will because it's all water weight anyways.

2820,"IE Beginnings - April Update M/30 6'0"" SW: 493, CW: 448, GW: 300","Hello everyone,

  
This is my April update on my weight loss journey using IE. A few positive things, I've noticed things in my body as I finish my third month. For starters, the dark spots around my neck are gone! I read these came as a result of insulin resistance. They're gone now and that's a big confidence boost for me. My stomach has also become more sensitive to my food options. I noticed I get loose bowels when I choose to eat the cheapest fast food. That's just a sign for me to be more watchful on my food choices. I can't reward myself by going all out on my feeding window or this trend was bound to continue. 

  
I also had some tough lessons I learned along the way. I learned I can not go and buy the food I will eat today as well as the food for the next feed window because it will be too much temptation. I found out the hard way especially during late night study sessions. I struggled with OMAD in the long run. The low feeding window was tough because I tried to overeat and ended up throwing up. This would also cause me to suffer through the next fast because I did not digest enough food. I switched to a 12hour feeding window while not eating past 7:00pm and this has helped me avoid those pitfalls. 

  
When it comes to drinking water, I had a similar problem upgrading from 1 gallon to 1.5 gallons. It was tough meeting my goal when I would procrastinate early in the day. However, the reminders on my phone have been helpful. I still can't believe I'm drinking 1.5 gallons when 3 months ago I could barely down one third of that. My support for appetite suppression has also been an enormous help. I doubled my tea intake by leaving my tea's brewing overnight and chugging them in the morning before making myself another batch. This has also helped me stay feeling full. It was interesting because one day I had finished my 28 hour fast as soon as I woke up but my appetite was gone after chugging my morning teas. I went for an extra 11 hours for a total of 39hours (a new record!) before breaking my fast. 

  
This is only my second time fasting for 28 hours but I'm enjoying it better than my 24 hour fast. I think it lends itself better with my 12 hour feeding window. Even though I did not lose the weight I was expecting this month, I learned a lot about myself.

2821,Fasting to reset hunger?,"I am here because I am hungry all of the time. I have pcos. I‚Äôm gaining weight after switching from standard American diet (very sick but skinny and underweight) to carnivore for 1 year so far. I have gained weight but then gone too far and gained too much. My energy is terrible, my mood sucks, I have pcos and hypothyroid (had these for 10 years). And insulin resistant. If I fast will that reset my appetite somehow so that I am not always hungry? I can‚Äôt reach satiety without having 1500-2000 calories at a time. I am always hungry and can easily eat 6000 calories in a day. I‚Äôve been eating about 1:1 protein and fat. I‚Äôve tried higher fat lower protein and vice versa. Was told I need to fix my leptin....is this how I do that? How do you fix an abnormal appetite where you‚Äôre hungry all the time and energy problems? I‚Äôve already done the traditional approach and stopped eating carbs which didn‚Äôt help. I was 20 lbs underweight. Now I‚Äôm 20 lbs overweight. And eating more each day. How much fasting is needed to develop a normal person appetite?

2822,Should I be counting calories during my eating period?,"From what I've read about fasting , it seems to be that the science points to eating less often can help get a calorie deficit to lose weight.

During my scheduled to eating times I am pretty much always hungry and constantly eating. Whereas before I started fasting I would go a good couple to several hours before eating another meal. 

Is this normal to feel like I need to eat so much more during eating times? Should I be restricting my calories?

Sidenote: I'm fairly active with both biking and doing aerial silks 3 times a week. I also only eat whole foods ( fresh fruits, veggies, meats) and the occasional whole grains.

I can skip breakfast, but skipping lunch takes its toll.

  


I can however fast on the weekends without much issue, but that's only 2 days a week, sometimes 1 if overtime is required. Is fasting only one or two days a week even worth it?

17 net carbs

2831,Reflections 1 month in,"38F / 5‚Äô11 / SW: 160 / CW: 153 / GW: 140

Started with 16:8, but quickly found that this schedule didn‚Äôt work for me. I felt anxious; binged the last hour. Moved to 17:7, and tried my first OMAD 1.5 weeks in. Now at 18:6, with 1-2 OMAD days/ week. This is the correct feeding schedule for me. I know this because:

-I feel really good. Energized, focused. I found that once I straightened out my eating schedule, my sleep schedule naturally fell into 7 hours (11pm-6am), and I felt excess energy during the day. I am a heavy pot smoker, and had been concerned about its compounding effects on my rest and diet. I feel so much better, that this concern has been greatly alleviated. 

-so, while I didn‚Äôt plan to, I got more exercise. After a week, I bought a jump rope, and put in about 10 minutes/day. After 2 weeks, I felt comfortable introducing 15-20 minute beginner HIIT workouts every day. Was sedentary throughout quarantine. 

Here are some things I did that are working well in that they feel long-term sustainable (my goal is not wholly weight oriented, but more general health):

-Gallon water jug. Sounds simple, but I make a ritual of filling it each morning. It took me about the entire month to get used to drinking this much water, but I‚Äôm motivated that my skin looks better!

-Apps for Calorie tracking (MyFitnessPal) and fasting (Fastic). Understanding your TDEE. I didn‚Äôt know about TDEE before; now that I‚Äôm tracking calories against it, I find I don‚Äôt need to make dramatic cuts to achieve a little progress every month. Plus, it‚Äôs made me so mindful of what I consume. Slow and steady works for me. 

-Alcohol reduction. I was previously spending about $50/ month on wine. Breaking that down, it‚Äôs about a bottle/week, which is less than 1 glass/ night. So while I didn‚Äôt consider myself much of a drinker, NOT keeping wine in the house this past month has shown me how many mindless sugar calories I would have consumed otherwise. I wasn‚Äôt really ever getting drunk, just nursing 6-8 oz and generally letting some go to waste. Now that quarantine restrictions are lifting, I plan to only drink alcohol outside the home.

-No sauce. Replacing ketchup with tomatoes, salad dressing with fruit. It feels luxurious. I have always enjoyed cooking, but this kind of stuff makes me feel like a fancy chef.

-OMAD/ cuisine rotation. Once a week, my OMAD will be from a local restaurant. I‚Äôll go to town on the menu. I look forward to choosing where I‚Äôll eat each week. 

-No diet drinks. I replaced diet soda with seltzer water. This was easy to do, and showed me again how much bad crap I was mindlessly consuming.

-More fiber and probiotics. My digestive system needed some help to adjust to this schedule, so I started seeking out these foods to right it.

Hope this helps. Thanks for indulging.",intermittentfasting,1617213631

When I started IF almost 3 weeks ago, I weighed in at 125 lbs. When weighing myself this morning, I was still at 125 lbs. Somedays, I would be at 124lbs but have been more consistently at 125lbs. I know that people with less fat struggle to lose fat since their body holds onto it. I got my BMI reported and it came back as slightly overweight. I would be more content with losing a pound a week but haven't even had that.

2896,How to deal with hunger symptoms while doing OMAD,"I'm 24F, 5'5 and 193 lb. My goal is to be in the 160s again.

For context: in 2016, I did OMAD (only having coffee in the morning, only eating at dinnertime and maybe a light snack afterwards). I went from 170 to 155 lb in less than two months, and it has been the only successful way I have ever lost weight.

Throughout the pandemic I've gotten back into exercising every day, which is good. I also tried to just count calories of what I was eating, though admittedly I wasn't very consistent. However, I have NOT made a net loss throughout the whole past year. Which is why I'm trying OMAD again, because it was the only thing that ever worked for me.

However, while starting it up again I am experiencing pretty bad hunger symptoms. Dizziness, headaches, having trouble focusing, etc. I don't work at the moment so I don't exactly need the extra energy, but even just sitting at home, the symptoms are pretty uncomfortable. But I know that if I have just one little snack, I will want to keep eating and eating. I don't remember how I managed this before lol. 

Does anyone have advice for being more comfortable while fasting? Should I just power through it and I'll get used to it? Anything I should add to my routine? Thanks in advance.",intermittentfasting,1617137437

2915,IF and Weight Training,"Just wanting some feedback.

I used to religiously eat within my anabolic window.  And even though I did this for years, I'm not even super convinced it actually exists.

Right now I'm not trying to gain though, I've been cutting weight hard for a few months now and had some great success with lowering carbs and intermittent fasting.  

My current plan has me on OMAD, generally breaking my fast at 6 pm and being done with food by 7, and extending my window from 3-7 (20/4) on Saturdays and usually fasting from Saturday night until Monday night for 48 hours.  This might be too extreme and I'm wondering if I'm sabotaging myself.

I said all that to say this; I'm trying to really up my weight training as well but I don't want to eat too late.  I'm looking at changing my work out to right after work, being done with lifting and cardio by 7 or 7:30, but I would be eating a little later than I'd like in this scenario.

Right now I'm thinking of breaking fast at 3:00, eating my meal, working out right after work at 5:30 and leaving it to just water for the rest of the night.  Or, maybe just waiting until after my workout and breaking my fast at about 7:30 or 8, but I'd prefer not to eat within 3 hours of going to sleep.

2951,"Just did a 5-day fast, got easier, however... was this normal?","Let me just start by saying that this is amazing and I wish I had done this years ago. I am a 36M, 6' 0"", SW260 CW243 GW195. I have been on and off keto 3 times over the past three years, the first time broken because of stress and the second time because of finances (and I was not on OMAD/fasting at the time; it's really inexpensive to fill up on complex carbs like brown rice, oatmeal, black beans, bread. Throw in some cheap chicken, onions, cabbage, and butter and Bob's your uncle).

While I had lost a lot of weight the first keto session, the real reason I started a third time was because A) I heard of the benefits of fasting-induced autophagy. The longest-lived people on my mother and father's side are also smaller and barely eat more than once a day and B) my new job demands a degree of physical fitness not to be wiped out every shift, since it's 12 hours where you in addition to your other tasks need to walk about 8-10 miles a night. So shedding weight would help.

I took a month to get fat-adapted again, losing about five pounds. Then I started fasting. And I'm amazed by the results. First fast: 60 hours, lost three pounds. I switched to OMAD/4:20 since then for about 10 days. Second fast: 78 hours, lost five pounds. I had a 1,500 calorie refeed (steak, eggs, butter, kimchi, pecans) and went immediately into my next fast.

This one was a little harder. By day three of five, my hunger was almost completely gone. However, TMI warning:&gt;!I've also been passing water like crazy. And not through the usual path, if you get my drift. It feels like every hour I expel about a fourth of a cup of water; I've been paying a lot of attention to my fluids and have been drinking water to make up for what I expel. Since I've been fasting, there's nothing in it but chyme and water. Note that I don't think my shedding of water weight from glycogen depletion was a factor, because I've had fasts in the past and had been doing keto for some time. While some of that water was execreted, most of it was urinated. This time, all this water was excreted.!&lt;

By day five (today), I was concerned about losing electrolytes, so I supplemented on the fourth day with a calcium tablet (not sure of calcium, it was a Tums), 400 mg of magnesium, 3g of potassium through potassium chloride salt, and 2g of sodium (4g of pink salt). The good news is that my splitting headache I had from waking up went away. The bad(?) news is that after a few hours, it completely killed my hunger. Like, not the normal 'no problem' hunger I've been getting from hunger, I was getting the 'oh god I never want to eat anything else again for the rest of my life hunger'. The kind of hunger I got from being a cereal-eating sugar-burner who skipped 16 hours of eating and my weakened body was dying for something, but I just couldn't convince my stomach and tongue to go along with it.

I broke my fast forcefully by eating some keto chili and a half of cup of yogurt. It was torture getting it down, but the feeling of anti-hunger and weakness went away a few minutes later.

So what I'm asking is... was that experience normal? Should I have avoided supplementing electrolytes? Should I just not have tried to jump in with a five-day fast a day after my second one?

I do want to fast some more. My skin is absolutely glowing, I'm sleeping much better, and I'm shedding weight at a rate I never thought possible. I just don't want to go into a bad place, you know?",intermittentfasting,1617063613

2960,223lbs to 180lbs: how I did it and what worked for me,"I am a 35 y/o male, 5'10"" tall and was 223lbs when I really decided I had to take my health more seriously. I am now hovering around 180-185lbs and don't plan to go much lower than that at this time. This change took me about four months, from December 2020 until now (end of March 2121).

I've battled weight on and off for some years now. I used to be active duty military and transitioned a few years ago into the reserves. The military was something that kept me in check when I was younger, and being younger I could essentially run away from a bad diet. This was fine and all, but over-training injuries did take their tolls on me and really started to manifest themselves in my later 20's. This meant I had to scale back the workouts and couldn't beat myself up as much. 

Fast forward to 2020. I was deployed overseas in Europe (a pretty great assignment until COVID-19 came along) and I put on a lot of weight. We were locked down and the gym on our little base was closed and I was pretty miserable. Add in the fact that our only source of food was a contractor feeding us processed crap and I was pushing my heaviest weight yet. I couldn't button up the fly on my uniform pants and I often wore a baggy lightweight jacket to hide my gut. 

When I got back stateside and was going through my post-deployment health assessment, my blood pressure was 155/100 and they almost wouldn't let me leave to go home until I underwent further health screening. I basically BS'd the doctors into letting them think it was 'white coat syndrome' and my BP was normally much lower.

A few weeks later my wife kept insisting I go see a doctor about my chronic knee soreness, and I did so. Arrived at the doctor and my BP was 158/108 and the doctor was like ""you need to get this under control immediately or you're going to have a significant cardiac event way too early in life."" She also said ""I can write you a prescription for an anti-inflammatory med and get you into physical therapy for your knee, but if you want to get better you're going to have to lose some weight."" 

It was basically all the wakeup I needed. Here is what I did:

o Intermittent Fasting 18:6 - pretty standard, I skip breakfast and eat lunch at noon, another snack at around 2-3pm, and then dinner at 6pm (sometimes later, depending on how long it takes to cook). I find that skipping breakfast and pushing my fast later and later into the day is easier if I start off my day with a good tough workout. I tried a couple 24 hour long fasts and thought I was going to faint. Anything longer than 18-20 hours is really pushing it for me.

o Mediterranean Diet (or something like that) - I cut out a lot of stuff from my diet, namely processed sugar and processed carbs and, really, anything processed that I could do without, within reason. I still eat all food groups and sub-groups, I'm just very picky about it being fresh, cooked from scratch, healthy, and unprocessed. It helps that I'm an adventurous eater and love to cook and prefer things made from scratch. I think a willingness to cook is key to a healthy diet, because processed food introduces a ton of refined starches and sugar into your diet, and a lot of food companies go to great lengths to make certain foods come off as healthy and wholesome and nutritious, when really it's a Trojan Horse for processed starches and sugars and bad fats. Perfect examples include stuff like hummus, bread, cheeses, oatmeal, yogurt, salad dressing (and other condiments) and just about any easy to grab snack bar you can name. Read your ingredients and nutrition labels, people. They'll sneak some pretty bad stuff in on you and won't even know it. 

I still eat carbs daily, at almost every meal in fact. I think that cutting all carbs, for me, is a short term solution to a long term problem and I've found that super low carb diets don't work for me in the long term. I've cut carbs before and done Keto/paleo before, and had great success with that, but the real challenge comes in keeping the weight off, and I found that I was really struggling when not eating any bread, pasta, rice, or potatoes. 

I try to focus on eating healthy, high quality, unprocessed carbs, and try to get a variety of carbs. Most Americans get their carbs from 3 primary sources: grains, potatoes, and rice. That's fine, but I mix in some stuff like buckwheat, quinoa, beans, and lentils. When I eat grains I go for whole grains, so that means whole grain bread and pasta and brown rice. There's a ton of nutrients in whole grains, and a surprising amount of protein. Lentils are, honestly, gross, but if you cook them right and add lots of spices and fresh herbs they're actually pretty great, and the nutritional benefits of lentils are far beyond anything else out there (I found a red lentil pasta that is both delicious, has a good chew/texture, and is 21g of protein per serving!!!)  

I eat a ton of veggies and try to get them into my diet wherever possible. I don't hold back on eating veggies, and eat them as a snack when I get hunger cravings.

I stay away from butter as my primary cooking lipid and opt instead for quality extra virgin olive oil.

I eat a lot less meat than I used to, and red meat is a special treat for me. A lot (about 1/3 to 1/2) of my meals are vegetarian or vegan, and I have to make an effort to get an extra protein source in there to make up for the lack of meat. Protein, like carbs, should come from diverse sources, not just meat, and I try not to make meat my primary source of protein like it used to be (thank you, lentils and beans). 

I could do better by eating more fish, but good fish is expensive and I just don't think it's that tasty. I do like shrimp though, and eat it once a week.

My wife has also lost weight on this diet, even though she has a very healthy weight and didn't need to lose any (she's about 5'5"" and 120lbs). She's one of those jerks that has built-in portion control and doesn't ever overeat. I use her portion sizes as a metric on which I judge if I'm eating the appropriate amount. 

I do occasionally have a drink (I enjoy wine, beer, and whiskey) but I'd say I have a drink maybe once a month, and never more than two drinks in one sitting.",intermittentfasting,1617052578

2970,Keto fasting and exercise discussion/help,"hello everyone let me start off with a little background info. I am 28(m) 6'1 tall. I currently weigh 295 lbs. I have been doing Keto and intermittent fasting OMAD mostly for little over a year now. I did weigh 413 lbs and have been doing good until now. I started to hit a sever plateau around 285. I have taken some time off to try and refocus and recharge. Now I feel I am ready to get AFTER IT again and and hit my goal weight for now of 250 lbs. I do go to the gym minimum of 3 times a week with a trainer doing mostly hilt workouts with weights. Typical workout is upper body on Tuesday, Legs Wednesday and Fridays full body. I try to walk minimum of 4 miles on non gym days at a track. My job is physical most days. I did tar my ACL few years back and had surgery on it. When doing activity were I twist a lot it will get very sore. My goals for right now is to lose the weigh and build muscle and better endurance. I don't want to look like a tank but have good muscle tone.

What I came here to discuses is my plan of action as of now. Ill get to it below. I would like some input on were I could be making a mistake or how to improve. Keep in mind this is a new plan. Its just a little more intense from what I was doing before. You will notice that I eat breakfast everyday. I will absolutely crash if I don't.

My usual week as followed
Monday I would wake up at 5 hit the track 4miles walking. Then I would break my fast with bone broth and prepare breakfast. Usually 3 fried eggs, 3 strips of bacon, half of a asparagus bundle roasted in butter, usual some avocado not always. 1 cup of coffee with heavy cream. I make sure I get at least 1 gallon of water in through the day with some keto chow electrolyte drops. I'm not going to state the water. Just know I get it in everyday. After breakfast I would start my OMAD fast. Some times I would have a bang energy once in a while through the week usual around lunch.
Tuesday wake up 530 and hit the gym for a upper body hilt workout. Come home and break fast with bone broth. Eat a very similar breakfast as above. I would then eat lunch around 12. typical meal would be 2 pork chops with some broccolini. Dinner would be around 6ish. Either salmon or steak with some kind of green vegetable.
Wednesday wake up 630 and go to gym for leg day. Come home and make breakfast. OMAD rest of day.
Thursday wake up 5am hit the track 4 miles. Break fast with broth then eat breakfast. OMAD rest of the day.
Friday wake up 630 and go to the gym for full body HILT workout. Break fats with broth then eat breakfast. OMAD rest of day.
Saturday and Sunday would basically be the same as like a Thursday.

Were I have some concern is with working out. With doing OMAD will I be gaining any muscle or would I be setting my self back? Should I be eating a normal 3 meals a day on days I workout or just eat a very large breakfast?

I did a bit more exercise than usual last week due to moving my office at work and going on a 5 mile hike through the woods this weekend.

Do I stop IF for a few days and keep the keto? Do I try a 48 or 72hr fast? Do I just keep doing what I've been doing all along and change nothing? Maybe I should have some simple carbs like a tuna sandwich? 

I have recently started trying to eat paleo + keto, so I'm having items like Hemp Seed and Flax seed as well as green beans and brussels sprouts. It's hard to tell since it has only been a week long stall but adding fiber doesn't seem to be the solution.

I've been self-isolating and thus cannot do grocery shops. Local deliveries have a bit waiting list and I couldn't afford to keep eating takeaway deliveries. I've been interested in fasting and thought, why not make use of this opportunity. 

It went great. I ate a small amount of food on Monday (2 bananas and a sandwich), and then I ate nothing until 10am today. It felt great and was surprisingly easy - I was even tempted to continue fasting, but from what I have read this is not recommended for beginners. 

I just broke my fast with a banana, and instantly felt diarrhoea coming. Sorry for the gross details but across two poop sessions it was a black, greasy/sludgy tar like stool which was slightly concerning.

3005,weight loss stalled.,"apologies for the wall of text but I wanted to address everything before hand.  


Hi Guys,   
  I am one of those who has tried all kinds of diets and either done it incorrectly or not been able to sustain it in the past. IF+keto-ish feels a little different though with the lack of cravings, and stressing about what to eat and when to eat.   


So I started my diet journey, for the upteenth time, about 2-3 weeks where the first 10 days just involved cutting out grain and using very little oil and fat in my diet (no IF at this point) and I lost 2.5 Kgs. This was not easy to do with hunger pangs every few hours.    


Then when I got convinced that IF has to be given a shot (and properly this time around), I started with 24 hours the first day, 48 hours the next 2 days, 20 hours for the next 3-4 days and settled on 16-18 hours now for the past 3 days with ONE proper meal at dinner and keto snacks in the eating window  
I settled on the 16-18hours because I was feeling a lack of energy after 18 hours and it didnt feel good.  probably cuz I was eating 6-700cals a day.   
Anyway in the past 10 days of IF I have lost 2.5kgs again.   
So in total 5. These 5 kgs could all be water weight for all I know. 

My meals before the 16-18 hours would mostly be a ketoish diet with 1 slice of sourdough bread just to satisfy my love or bread and come out to be around  6-700 cals. Since the 16-18hour schedule, I have added snacks like almonds and cheese and decaf coffee with cream which come to be around 3-350cals.  So in total around 1050cals which seems to be perfect for my mostly at home, sedantary life.   
My overall food composition is coming to be 50% fat, 15-25% carbs and 25% protein. carbs being around 20-55gms a day.   


Now my weight as stalled for the past few days and infact I might have gained 500gms. I am worried that If this stays here for 1 week or so, that I might lose the disciple and the motivation to keep going.  


1 - What could i be doing wrong?   
2 - do I need to stop bread for a few days and get past this plateau?   
3 - Could it be the lack of excercise?   
What worries me is that if I am eating less than 1200 calories and even that is not enough to trigger my body to use the fat to burn, then what chance do I really have?   
No I havent really lost inches either on my waist, chest or thighs yet.  


I use samsung health as my app to log calories. If you guy have some experience with this app being incorrect in values, then do let me know.   


Other than that, I feel great! my stomach is better and not bloated all the time, my stress levels are down, my cravings and hunger pangs are gone,   
There is one issue of libido though and I havent had a boner or sexual thoughts or felt like fapping ever since I started IF. I am hoping it sorts itself out in some time. Not like I can do anything with an erection in this lockdown.",intermittentfasting,1622629487

3047,Finally decided to join the IF train!,"Hi everyone!

I'm a 27 yo NB (agab female) who weighs around 185lbs and I've been struggling a lot with weigh loss for a long time. I'd love to go down to 150\~ but I was never really active and I usually over-eat when stressed. That's why I decided it's time to change my life for the better so I'm looking to join a gym, eat healthier and seriously start IF (started two days ago!)

So here comes my question. I am helping myself using the Fastic app, but as I read the most optimal IF for begginers would be 16:8, but the app is telling me to do 14:10 instead. Is it enough to start or should I try 16:8? With 14:10 I noticed I'm not really that hungry while fasting, and since hunger is something I always struggled with in my daily life, I'm kind of surprised. Am I doing something wrong here? I've been only drinking water and chamomille tea while fasting these days.

Anyway, nice to meet you all! Hope I can post back in a few months with some progress in this exciting new journey. :)  Thank you guys so much to inspire me for finally trying!!",intermittentfasting,1622572416

Disappointingly, I haven't seen that big of a body change. So I started a little research and found some conflicting information online. I just want to ask the community if they can verify or give me advice: 

As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently on 16:8 where I eat between Noon - 8pm. I found online that it's not good to not eat during the 16 fasting window because it lowers your metabolic rate. Overtime, your body will adjust to the lower metabolic rate so when you eat during your eating window, your body is adjusting to the lower intake and will take more time to burn off the calories - which I feel like defeats the purpose of IF.

M : 42 yo : 321 lbs

Currently I have been focusing on IF and Counting for a week.  I have lost 9 pounds thus far.  Like most here I am a life long yo-yo'er so I know this first week really was the easy part.  My body probably just thinks this is a cute game, after all I have an entire humans worth of extra weight to lose.

All in all it has been pretty straight forward.  I eat between 12:30 and 20:30 and try to target my cutting TDEE (\~2400) though honestly I often end up lower and hitting around 1900 putting me at a pretty good deficit.  Also I rarely eat after dinner (but its nice to know I can if I need to) just because I'm not hungry.  I track what I can in My Fitness Pal but didn't do too good with that over the weekend, I am much more studious during the week.  Right now my main goal is getting out of the 300 weight class ASAP.  Long term goal is to be able to start doing more outdoor activities like canoeing and kayaking.  I'm telling ya nothing will make you want to lose weight faster than realizing you are too fat for a friggin' boat.  

I have drastically increased the amount of water I am drinking as well along with completely cutting out Candy, Soda, and general snack food.

3078,"33M, 5'9"", SW:243 lbs, CW:203lbs, GW:161lbs - One Month Later","It's been just over one month since my first post about starting Intermittent Fasting. It all started with an inspirational post from [u/chanel\_\_\_oberlin](https://www.reddit.com/u/chanel___oberlin/) that just made me rethink my whole perception of how I was trying to lose weight.

Since that time I've dropped from 221lbs to 203lbs. A rough average of 3lbs per week over 6 weeks but it's definitely not tracked that way on the chart, with one week being a non-mover (much to my frustration!) and others being single pound weeks. But it's all progress.

This week I honestly thought I would be weighing in at 200lbs, but it wasn't to be. I was disappointed but unperturbed. It would have been a mammoth loss to have hit 200lbs this week; dust off and assess what happened in the week that might have caused it.

I still insist that anyone thinking about starting Intermittent Fasting needs to stop thinking and act! Don't waste time wondering if it might work or if it might be difficult or if it might not be for you. The only way to learn that is to actually try it. 

My wife was not wild on the idea of fasting, so she tried 12:12. It didn't stick. She doesn't like the restriction of not being allowed to eat after a certain time, but she now knows it's not for her. She has already started to focus on a more exercise-centric routine, without having to compromise on sweet things that she can have as and when the craving hits.

I'm proud of her for coming with me on the weight loss journey, even if we aren't going to walk an identical path to achieve it.

If one fasts for say, 16-18 hours, the sympathetic nervous system may burn itself out for the day, and once you break the fast in spectacular fashion your parasympathetic runs the show for a while.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to post anything, as this feels really self congratulatory, but I figured if I could inspire someone to keep going, or even start IF, it would be worth it! 



I started 20:4 during the work days back in November. Constant knee pain, foot pain, and heart flutters from normal activity finally ground my last nerve down, so it seemed like the time to do something about it. It was hard at first, but by sticking with it and building good habits, it's just second nature to eat in certain blocks of the day. My gf and I are both heavier, sturdily built humans, so we've constantly been trying new diets, and for me, IF is the only method that I've been able to stick with. In January, I added weekend fasts of 16:8, and since March, I've been able to add CICO and my lady has me doing Noom as well. I've also gotten a bicycle, and ride 8-9 miles 4+ times a week. And, I want to start cycling to work when the cicadas calm down. 



IF has really changed my life. I've always been the fat kid, the fat brother, the fat friend. But now, my mom and brother exclaim ""WHO'S THIS SKINNY GUY!?!?"" when I walk in the door. My feet, knees, ankles, and heart no longer give me any trouble, which is something I still can't wrap my mind around, since I was just so used to it. My memory is better, and the depression I've been dealing with through the pandemic has gotten much lighter and easier to manage. My clothes even fit again too! How is this much progress possible, and how do I feel this good, even though I'm still classified as obese!? 



I don't have any real photos of when I was at my heaviest that I know of (I'll look around to see if I can make a real progress pic post). 



Lastly, if you're on the fence about IF, please try it. Give it 3-4 weeks. It might change your life in a way that you never knew possible, and your body, mind, and spirit will thank you. Also, remember to drink your water! Thank you r/intermittentfasting!!!",intermittentfasting,1622486490

I'm doing a 16/8 IF, with my first meal around 13h30 and diner at around 19h30, with a snack in between.   
I only track my calories when I take meals that are very different than my usual routine.   
I eat what I want, and I don't deprive myself. I take my time and I don't feel any frustration for now :).   
For those who know her, I also do the Chloe Ting challenges. They are very good workout plan with beginner version of every exercices. [https://www.chloeting.com/program/2021/weight-loss-challenge.html](https://www.chloeting.com/program/2021/weight-loss-challenge.html)   


I also try to eat non transformed food as much as I can. I can share some pictures of my meals if you guys are interested.

3152,"I'm Going on a 14 Day Fast Starting Mon, May 31, 2021 @ 12:00 pm (00:00)","This is for accountability. You can join me if you want. :) 

Everytime I attempt a fast pass 24 hours I get ""anxious"". Not hungry, but anxious. I'm in the habit of eating until I'm completely full. So when my stomach empties around the 8 hour mark it gets harder and harder to keep myself from running to the kitchen and preparing something unhealthy.

My mom enables me to eat when she sees that I haven't eaten in a while. I don't know what goes through her head, but if me and my (non existing) daughter weighted together equals 630 lbs, I would be looking for ways get us motivated to drop excess weight because it's unhealthy.

I want to lose 142 lbs. I'm currently 24, 5'7"", &amp; 262 lbs. My goal weight is to be 120 lbs, but some days I wonder if I will ever take control of my eating. It's saddening.

That's why today I'm posting this in hopes of shaming myself into sticking to my fast. Also, I want to clear out my colon as well. My digestion has been bad for a while, but I keep loading myself with food. I'm hoping these few days will help with that.",intermittentfasting,1622439398

3158,265 - 220 / 18:6 / 18 months,"Started IF in quarantine -- 18:6 most days. After a year I didn't fast on Saturdays which made it easier for me, but did slow progress (I've been stuck at 220 for about 2 months now). It's important to take a starting photo - because even after a 45 pound loss, I still looked in the mirror and wasn't sure it was worth the effort. Seeing them side by side tells the true story (even though I've dropped to a 34 inch pant size and a L shirt size from 38-40/2XL).  I lift 2x a week using a simple 3x6 compound exercise regimen and run once or twice a week depending on weather.  Simple!

I used to over eat or go to junk food before IF when I was upset or angry.  Now I have noticed lately that  I tend to fast longer,  even up to 36 hours when I'm feeling like that.   I think it may be a way for me to feel in control when I don't have any option in a situation, if that makes sense.    Anyone else have experience with this?",intermittentfasting,1622419781
3165,"Does anyone get little ""plateaus"" when you shouldn't get them?","Basically I've been on/off IF for the last couple of years because of routine incompatibilities. I'm now trying to stick to it and have been for almost a month. It feels great again, to be honest, I always feel better when I'm fasting than when I'm not. The first week was terrible (isn't it always?) but now I can do it easily, depending on the days.

So here's the thing, the first three weeks I was losing weight quickly as one almost always does, but the during the 4th week I lost absolutely nothing. This wouldn't normally bother me but it is kind of disappointing since it was a week of change and very little time to eat. I've done two 24h fasts, two 20h fasts and the other three were above 18h (I usually do 17:7). Not only that but I went from sitting most of the time to walking around almost every day. 

So, in theory, I should've lost more. In practice, the scale didn't move this week.

Anyone want to share their experience while I convince myself that this is temporary and that I should keep my motivation up? I know that a week is not a big deal, but lately losing weight has been a big part of feeling better with myself.",intermittentfasting,1622419479

3168,How to start IF when you get incredibly shaky?,"I've tried to start IF multiple times. I would startvwith a 16x8. Eating from 12pm to 8pm. But NY around 10:30am to 11:30am I will start to get shaky and irritable and sometime nauseous/dizzy. 

During this time I usually have meetings at work or I have to finish something for work. 

I dont cut back the hours to 10:30 to 6:30 because my partner get home around 5:30pm or so and I cool dinner which most of the times take an hour. 

How do I get around that shaky/nauseous feeling?

I dont drink soda or eat a lot of sugar/sweets. I don't have diabetes or anything. Im healthy ""for my weight"". But when I get in to one of these episodes, the only thing I've found to help is the eat something as fast as I can before it gets to the point of me being worthless.",intermittentfasting,1622417291

Sometimes me and my buddies do monthly challenges and for this upcoming month, I'd like to try intermittent fasting where I eat my first meal at 6:00am followed by lunch at 12:00pm. I'd like to continue my running routine which would be 2x week 5km, 1x week 10km, plus 1 time 21km at the end of the month. I do that at 17:00 when I finish work.

for 3hrs i was bloating, (trying to belch to alleviate the pain)

the water was from tap and likely chlorinated or treated water

it came from 6pm ish? (where i live this is just turn night time ) idk if water companies have cycles or if day time heat changes water during the day and at night the chlorine is more active.  

I've seen this type of post in IBS ( irritable bowel syndrome ) reddit forums, but i don't think i have that.  i.e.  search google for ""bloated because of water"" etc. 

Has anyone else had this issue? or know where to research? 

I thought about going to the doctor but its not re-occuring frequently maybe 1 time over 3 months... 

it just really hurts for 3 hrs, can't distract myself from the pain, my stomach gets larger, I can feel it move through all the organs as the pain slowly goes down till i pass wind.

3238,Seeing results &amp; happy,"I'm a 45 year old male. If you never seen the movie ""Money Pit"" with Tom Hanks that was my life from 2014 until 2019. I was 178 lbs &amp; active before the house purchase in Las Vegas.  I've never had a problem with my weight before. As a result of stress (house/life/family) &amp; anxiety I fell into a slump of depression. My diet was horrible &amp; I was smoking 1.5 packs a day. I started gaining weight and went from a 32 waist to a 34 (never weighed myself because I'm a guy). Within this time I found out my primary care doctor was a POS and wasn't really doing anything for me partly why my health was suffering. I found this out after I started seeing a therapist &amp; under her recommendation found a new primary doctor. The new doctor ran every test available &amp; also set me up with multiple specialist (cardiologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist, urologist). Long story short, Vitamin B &amp; D deficiency, salt way to high, potassium &amp; magnesium low, cholesterol high, and hypertension/high BP and gastritis to finish. Like I said old doctor tried to kill me &amp; wasn't listening. So we start getting things in order &amp; getting me healthy. Was rough because I picked up horrible eating habits (Damn you Lifesaver gummies!). So on my wife's birthday 09/2019 I decided to quit smoking &amp; get ""healthy"". Ugh! 25 year smoker going cold turkey... Rough is an understatement! But, I did it. Still not smoking... But in the process I gained a lot more weight. Here's what happened. October, candy &amp; Halloween. November, sweets/treats &amp; thanksgiving. December, sweets/treats &amp; Christmas. January Drinking &amp; dinning. February sweets &amp; treats. March..... Lockdown! Anxiety kicked in, depression came back &amp; I spiraled. We ended up buying a house with some acreage in the country in a slower town on the East Coast. That was by far the best choice I ever made (besides marrying my wife). Closed on it 09/2020. Had some stuff updated on it &amp; moved 02/2021. Made a choice to not bring the baggage, get healthy mind/body/soul. Started IF 8/16. Eventually switched to OMAD &amp; now hop OMAD 4 days &amp; 6/18 IF Fri-Mon. I can say IT WORKS! I was over 225 (easily 230) &amp; 36/37 in waist when we moved. I am now at 204 &amp; getting muscle/tone back. If I wasn't so badly out of shape the weight loss would be greater but I'm slowly replacing the lost muscle from being incredibly lazy for so many years. I'm starting my cardio &amp; workouts this week. Finally got the home gym unpacked. LoL.

 I found this group on reddit by chance &amp; have followed many of the members progress. I'm proud of myself &amp; everyone else here! The advice I have for those looking to start is first start small &amp; just get used to skipping breakfast. Don't jump on a scale immediately. We're all fat &amp; it isn't going away in a day! Small goals is what does it. But also plan your cycles. If your social like my family then adjust accordingly. That's why I cycle my week. I also try to give up some stuff early or later so I can enjoy larger portions/calories with the groups of folks I'm with. Also sugar &amp; the other bad stuff. Find an alternative. I'm not going keto but I've changed like 90% of deserts to keto to avoid sugar. I still eat normal food though on my meal plan. You have to just find a balance for what you want. I'm ok with a little slower progress because of my food choices. Just watch the calories you take in VS burn. That's the key!

Was just wondering if anyone had any tips for dealing with INTENSE sugar and carb cravings, exclusively 1-2 hours after you break your fast? 

I‚Äôve been doing 16:8 for a week or two (have previously had a lot of success with straight CICO but needed something new). I‚Äôm totally fine during my fasting period in terms of cravings. However, I break my fast with something high in protein at 12 and am full until around 1-1:30. At that point I become a hungry gremlin who just wants sugar and carbs. I‚Äôm insatiable! Once I eat some sugar/carbs I don‚Äôt even think about food again until dinner at around 7, but in my ‚Äúsnacky period‚Äù I‚Äôm reaching for foods that put me over my calorie limits (cookies, chips, etc).

In terms of sequencing the workout routine, should I be doing all cardio on the front or back end? Does it matter? And should the weightlifting be separated to the end of the day so it happens when I have some carbs/protein available?",intermittentfasting,1611843297

Now after 24 days (16 - 19 hr fasts) I am 81.4kg. This has seriously sapped my resolve after getting so close.

If I'm doing IF but also working out to gain muscle, how do I manage this best assuming I have ample body fat still? My stats: 165lbs 5'10'' male My thinking is:

1. Workout Days: Eat enough protein how many g's per lb of weight? Can still be in calorie deficit, fat burning will make up rest of maintenance calories + additional for muscle growth? Or do I need to be in surplus always?
2. Rest Days: Just be in calorie deficit, how many g's of protein do I need, to not lose muscle mass?

&amp;#x200B;

Also something that is confusing, how long do I start losing muscle mass? is 8-16 ok, before my body starts breaking down muscle?

I've been doing 18:6 because I want the benefits of fasting beyond 16 hours, however due to my work schedule, sometimes theres no opportunity to break my fast unless I do it early or two or so hours later when my shift is over. Is it ok to shuffle between 16:8 and 18:6 based on what I can mange? Or is it best to do 18:6 consistently? 

Do you fast everyday or do you take normal eating days? If so, does this affect your progress or making fasting harder?

3410,Issues with IF in my marriage :(,"Hello everybody, I would like to share some difficulties I've been having with my wife regarding fasting. :( I am currently about 2 kilos above my ideal weight, so actually I'm not doing fasting to lose weight, but just because I started feeling so much better, having so much more energy. I am currently doing 16/8 on the weekdays, which means essentially skipping breakfast. Even being the lightest form of fasting, my wife can't deal with that. She said she's traumatised because she had problems with anorexia in her family and herself stopped eating when she was a teenager, so every time she hears me talking about fasting or I just say ""I'll just have a black coffee"" she feels bad and uncomfortable and start acting strange with me. I try to understand that this is a delicate subject for her. At the same time it makes me very sad (and a little bit angry, I may say) that a thing that make me feel so good bothers her so badly, and that deep down there she just wants me to quit. So I wanted to know: has anyone had a similar situation in your relationship? How could you handle that? Thank you in advance!",intermittentfasting,1611760114
3412,IF and family dinners,I'm curious how folks with kids manage IF and family dinners. I have 3 kids under 9 and family dinners are important to me. I've been doing 16:8 IF for about 8 weeks and am LOVING it and usually eat from 10am - 6pm. I would really love to extend to 18:6 but it feels like the best way to do that would be to start my fast at 4pm.  I'm up at 5am most days and have very busy mornings with the kids and work and by 10am I'm usually cranky and tired. I often eat dinner around 5:30 with my family despite the fact that I'm not super hungry. So I am thinking I could just skip dinner to extend to 18:6. But then do I just sit at the table and not eat while my kids/husband do eat? (I think I've almost convinced my husband to do IF so he might be sitting with me.)

3415,Eating window at night?,"I've played with IF for a while, but the window that seems to work best for me is between 6 PM and midnight.

**So my question is this:** would having the eating window of a 18:6 plan between 6 PM and midnight (i.e., right before sleeping) undermine the effects of IF, since I'm sleeping on a full or partially-full stomach?

3428,"Can anyone check to make sure I‚Äôm doing IF correctly? Almost one month in, wanted to check in.","Started at 187lbs on 12/31/20. Right now I‚Äôm at around 177. I know myself, and I have to fully commit to something to stick with it - if I let myself cheat a little bit, then I abandon it pretty quickly. I did Keto last year, went from 189 to 169lbs. I‚Äôm a male, and probably my ideal weight is 170lbs.

10lbs in almost four weeks seems like a lot, but I started off the year with a 40 hour full fast to reset my metabolism. I lost 6lbs in the first two days of the year. Since that day, I have only lost about 3-4lbs, and I‚Äôm not sure if progress halted because I‚Äôm making any mistakes.

So I don‚Äôt have a formal eating window, so I don‚Äôt hand a standard 16:8 or anything. Although generally my ratio is about 20:4 or less, I have only gone to 18:6 and 19:5 maybe five times. But the way I do it is I just count the hours since my last meal and round down. For example I last ate 2-4pm yesterday, and today I‚Äôm anticipating eating at around 1-2pm, so I‚Äôll write down that I fasted for 21-22 hours (depending on when I actually eat). Is this fine? I don‚Äôt have a set window for eating because of my work responsibilities.

The other question I have is about miscellaneous calories. For the first couple weeks, I was putting a small amount of whole milk in my coffee in the mornings, not realizing how many calories and sugar are in milk. Since I realized that, I started using Chobani creamer, which is super sweet and strong, but it literally only requires a tiny splash (like a bottle cap full) to make my coffee taste how I want - I did the math and it‚Äôs absolutely less than 10 calories. Is this in any way ruining my fast?

Also, what‚Äôs the general consensus on multivitamins? I haven‚Äôt taken any yet, but I feel like I need to start back up again. I also take vitamin D because I work in a correctional setting and go four days without seeing the sun. Do multivitamins and vitamin D ruin fasting?

3433,Are you an abstainer or are you a restrictor (nod to Whiplash!)?,"&amp;#x200B;

As a long time lurker and journey starter, I'd thought I'd share this and get some comments.

Recently I discovered I had the type of personality which basically says...

'..why have 1 cookie when you can have a whole packet'

I have low/zero self control or will power. I'd start my weight loss program, then after 3 or 4 weeks my will power would diminish, the eating would rise and the pounds would pile on again. Yo Yo dieting I think is the term.

Then I discovered IF. Now I don't know if I am following the rules correctly, but I find id much MUCH easier to abstain from eating rather than reduce my eating. 

So every day for the last 2+ weeks I have stopped eating at 5pm. My partner has their meal at 8pm as usual, but I don't partake.

 I thought it would be hard, but in fact, in my case, I find abstaining so much easier than restricting. Sure I have to exercise some control, but not having food at my fingertips between 5pm and 10am make the whole reduction thing so much easier.

As the weight comes off, I find control of my breakfast and lunch calorie intakes a little easier.

It's been 2+ weeks since I binged. And that is a first.

7lbs down and on my way...

I've been reading up on keto rash, but according to what I've found out about it, it only affects your back and chest. According to same sources, the keto rash may be due to low carb intake and as I mentioned above - I probably should eat less carbs, since my diet is not very healthy.

I feel itchy on the inner parts of thighs, around belly button and on the chest. Sometimes I feel an itch around my wrinkles and neck, but not so often. 

At first I thought it may be a hygienic issue since I'm hairy (even though I maintain a skin care routine every day for sensitive skin type), so I've changed my body products with added scents etc. a week ago but it didn't help.

3435,Sharing my failure: Fasting with BAD self-control,"* Background:

F21 with a (really badly followed )16/8

Goal: Get within lower end of healthy bmi for aesthetics reasons: rid the facial and thigh fat. Flatten stomach.

Daily calorie intake: 1500-2500. **SW: 60kg CW: 58-59kg GW: 54-55kg Height 1,72m**

&amp;#x200B;

* Details:

I've been fasting for 3 weeks, and the 2 kilos were lost in the first 3 days. 

Then I was unable to force myself to start eating much later in the day, or stop eating at night.              
I'd eat at work whenever the hunger gets on my nerves( 13-14 am), once again at 7-8 pm, and snack before sleep 9-10 pm. The tracking app would scold me, but I kept on like a motherfucker. This way my fasting period is actually **on average 13-15 hours**, with occasional 16 hr success. 

I know, I have no discipline.

&amp;#x200B;

* Conclusion:

Now the moment of truth. I don't think I lost anything besides water weight. 

Admittedly, I look less puffy in the stomach and face. But the fat is there, and the scale hasn't even gone slightly lower than **58**.  It fluctuates a little bit depending on bowel movements LOL. I noticed I get more hungry at night when I fast in the morning, maybe the body is telling me to eat more.

So, no skinny legs and sharp cheekbones for me, huh?

I have been mostly eating eggs, chicken, fish, greens and fruits and my calorie consumption is around 800-900 calories per day. The food I have been eating is fairly low on calories so I would have to consume a lot of it to get a lot of calories. Not am I only fat, but I am also a very heavy build and have a fair amount of muscle, so my BMR is quite high, which puts me at a fairly massive calorie deficit every day.

I'm doing IF 5 out of 7 days. I do IF during the work week, and I probably go 12:12 on weekends, but I'm not keeping time. Besides the obvious, is there any negative health effects doing this? Does yo-yoing like that have harmful (even partially) side effects that I'm not aware of?

3489,High Fiber Bread,"Before the pandemic, I used intermittent fasting to lose ~15 pounds over a few months.  I've gained it back since being stuck working from home but I've recently gotten routines down again and feel about ready to get back into it.

Lately, I pretty much always eat peanut butter and banana sandwiches for lunch.  Because of the growing pandemic, I recently decided to try to not go grocery shopping for three weeks instead of the previous two weeks.  This means that, if I want bread, I have to make my own.  I looked for some simple whole wheat bread recipes on Youtube and found one.  I made a loaf.  It's definitely not like store-bought whole wheat, but it's like something I might get at a health-food store or a vegan restaurant.

The first thing I noticed is that I felt no hunger for an incredibly long time (like most of the next day) after eating a sandwich and a half (three slices of bread about the same thickness as sliced store-bought sandwich bread, but smaller in height) that evening.  After some calculation, I figured that the three slices would provide about 70% of the recommended dietary fiber for the day.  I've read before that lots of fiber can make you feel full/sated for longer, but I never experienced it like this before.

Now I just have to replace any evening comfort-eating I've been doing with something else, like calling a friend, playing a video game or exercising and I think I could easily go 16 hours without eating each day.",intermittentfasting,1611603622

What bothers me is that I need to take a vit D supplement, which isn't ideal that late in the day, I think. Plus I'm worried about the insulin spike after eating being higher in the evening, and about how all that might affect the body's natural clock.

My dilemma is that since the surgery, on most days I am lucky if I get 1,000 calories. I usually get in the neighborhood of 600-800. The reason I don‚Äôt get the calories in is I cannot eat very much, if I try to overdo it I get sick. Today, for example, at 11:00 am I had a zero fat, zero sugar, high protein Greek yogurt and two ounces of beef jerky for a total of 250 calories. At 3:00 I had a 16 ounce protein shake and a stick of cheese for a total of 540 calories. That‚Äôs all I have eaten today and feel sick after having the shake.

3580,Will eating rice cancel out some of the effects of IF?,"To clarify, what I mean by rice is white rice.

I eat rice with every meal. I'm asian, so this habit has been ingrained to me since I was a baby. My mom always says ""a meal without rice is not a meal at all.""

Anyways, I'm trying out 16/8 intermittent fasting. I'm no nutritionist here, so please bare with me. I've heard that what IF does is it brings our insulin levels down which causes our fat cells can to release their stored sugar, to be used as energy, hence burning fat. That's the entire concept of IF. However, I've read that eating white rice can increase the amount of insulin, or cause an ""insulin spike."" Isn't this counterproductive, then? The IF is just cancelling out the effects of white rice. Which means my potential for weight loss is lower.

It's not possible to directly remove white rice from my diet. Not only do I not want to do that (eating without rice just feels unnatural), it's literally not possible since every breakfast/lunch/dinner made for my family includes white rice.

However, every time I get on the scale, it says about the same thing as when I started (\~203 lbs and my target is 180), which is discouraging. I have been working out some and gained a little muscle, but if my belly has gotten any smaller, it's not by much.

During fasting periods, I have been drinking (in addition to straight water) Fit &amp; Active brand tea (sugar free powder mixed with water), sometimes with lemon or lime juice and Stevia sweetener added in. During fasting, I  have been chewing Extra brand sugar-free gum and have also sometimes had diet soft drinks. The tea and gum have 5 calories in a serving of each (I have been having lots of the tea), and Stevia has 2 carbs per packet (2-3 packets per half gallon of tea if I added it).

My eating windows typically start sometime around 2pm-4pm and end around 9pm-10:30pm, sometimes 11pm.

Why am I not seeing results? I thought I was supposed to be losing a pound or two each week. Am I doing something wrong? Are the few calories and carbs ruining everything?

I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô4‚Äù female and 44. I have been hashtag blessed that I‚Äôve NEVER looked my weight, so that 160 on me will look like 135 ;). I am an hourglass who has no desire to be a waif so that works for me. It took me a long time and a rather lengthy eating disorder to get to the point where I don‚Äôt give a shit what the charts say I ‚Äúshould be!‚Äù

My eating window is 5pm-9pm and during it I consume 1300-1400 calories of good, healthy food. I drink tons of water. I do take a casual day on the weekend that probably lands me at anywhere from 2200-2400 calories that day, which sure, I could stop doing but life is too damn short. 

Here‚Äôs the weird part: I‚Äôve been COVID funemployed since the end of November‚Äî-frankly I‚Äôm shocked I stayed employed that long working at a non profit, but it is what it is. I take my dog for a 2 hour beach walk in the morning and then I spend 4-5 hours on my recumbent bike while I read or look for jobs or watch TV. I DO know it‚Äôs a lot, but it‚Äôs basically sitting. I break a sweat some days, some days I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm in perpetual motion but it‚Äôs not a hardcore workout at all. 

I‚Äôve definitely lost 3 inches on my waist. I see a tiny bit of face gains. Clothes (the ones I‚Äôve pulled out that aren‚Äôt yoga pants or pjs haha) fit better. But with the  exception of Christmas week when I ate and drank booze to stuff down my feelings, I‚Äôve been doing this for 3 damn months and I feel like I should be a lot further along for the work I‚Äôm putting in. 

I started eating waaaay too few calories and adjusted up accordingly. I leave a window of 150 calories or so because realistically no matter how carefully we weigh or measure, it‚Äôs never 100% accurate. If I parse it out with the casual day, I‚Äôm eating probably 1500 calories a day‚Äî-and I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs ‚Äútoo little‚Äù. I don‚Äôt do the bike on weekends, but the dog boy gets his 2 hours daily.  Am I eating too much?

Or maybe‚Äîis it time to just accept I‚Äôm old and my metabolism has perished...and I‚Äôll never lose that last 20-25? All I want is to fit into the supremely adorable summer clothes I‚Äôve been carrying with me for the last 8 years (aka the last time I was ‚Äúthin‚Äù)

3663,"working my way down to 16:8, weird hunger when eliminating AM sugar in coffee","First off, I went through and read every post on here I could find about how people deal with their morning coffee. So although I'm new to this, I can see it's a touchy subject!

I've been slowly inching my way towards a 16:8 fast, with the eating window being around 2-10 pm. It was easy to ditch breakfast foods, and I've been going all morning on just my normal coffee, which has half and half and honey in it. I can easily coast until the early afternoon on just this, without ever thinking about food or hunger. 

So my next step was going to be eliminating the honey, then eliminating the half and half. And maybe just switching to tea altogether, because black coffee is kinda gross lol! 

But it's so strange, today I skipped the honey but kept some half and half and cinnamon, and I have been absolutely famished, with a growling stomach and a headache. I feel terrible, and I still have 2 hours before I would usually start to feel hungry. 

How could a tablespoon of honey make such a big difference in how I feel for *hours*? It's so bizzare to me. 

Although I did have it iced today instead of my normal hot (to help with the taste haha) I wonder if that has anything to do with it?",intermittentfasting,1614185713

I started 13 days ago and I weighed 210 lbs, and today I weighed 198.2 lbs.

We are in charge of how we react to any thought, feeling, or urge, even hunger. 
When I was in treatment for OCD I was tormented by intrusive thoughts. However, I learned that I did not have to believe every thought I had or even take action based on a thought or feeling.

I can pinch half an inch on my ribs and less on my lower abdomen, plus I have a small, very malleable tummy pouch. I was the same weight a year ago and had a slim tight figure, but then I gained water weight and possibly fat on birth control, and stopped working out for a while so had muscle loss. The skin became loose when I stopped the meds and the water/bloat disappeared. 

I‚Äôm back on yoga and healthy eating, trying to get my figure tight and firm again without being unfair to my body. 7.5 stone isn‚Äôt a fun threshold to descend past in my experience. However I don‚Äôt know if I can realistically fill all that space with just muscle so that it tones nicely. 

Can IF be used to decrease existing looseness in skin? I was thinking of incorporating it into my week and eating normal/surplus on yoga days for muscle building.

Weight has been something that I‚Äôve contended with for most of my life. Was brought up to always finish my plate and that habit stuck with me. Had some stints at the gym that I stuck to for decent periods and built a solid muscle base out of, combined with my job.

The biggest hurdle for me was always food - what I was consuming and how much. I‚Äôve tried dieting and controlling portions through the day but I always found the problem that when I started to eat, I wouldn‚Äôt stop.

Recently however I‚Äôve been watching of all people Steve-O from Jackass openly talk about his battle with severe drug addictions and how he overcame those and I thought to myself ‚Äúif a bloke that wild can overcome his demons and turn into one of the most well adjusted and balanced people around I have no excuses.‚Äù

So cut shot to me now. 29, male, 5‚Äô7 and sitting around the 110kg mark (242 lbs for the non metrics).

No real specific goal weight in mind, just a noticeable reduction in size/body fat is the goal!

Ive been intermittent fasting for 3 days now. My typical day to day routine is as follows:

Wake up at 5am.

5:30am protein shake/workout supplement (caffeine, low sugar) - total combined is around 120 calories.

Go to work, usually finished work anywhere between 11am-1pm

Having a decent sized lunch (for example yesterday was a steak, 2 eggs, chips and a full cob of corn).

Essentially eating nothing for the rest of the day, sleeping at around 9-10pm.

This means I‚Äôm working roughly on the 16:8, some days that‚Äôll push to a 17:7 or even 18:6 depending on when I finish up at work.

What I‚Äôd love some advice on:

I don‚Äôt necessarily want to lose too much lean muscle/muscle mass. Would sinking in another protein shake be suggested and would there be any harm in taking one (in terms of ruining the fast) in taking it towards the evening or should I have one earlier on (say with lunch) to stretch the fasting window?

Would this be sustainable for 7 days or should I break it up on weekends where I resume a normal 2-3 meals a day deal?

I‚Äôm currently not going to the gym at the moment (unfortunate COVID closures and what not) - would I need to consume more if I continue the one meal a day while partaking in strength training?

I committed to making a change in October 2019, tried to take ""before"" pictures by the following spring, and a year later, I still looked the same. I felt embarrassed, especially because my life (thankfully) was virtually unchanged due to COVID and I really didn't have any excuses.

I tried IF/OMAD in a way that included large meals that I would eat within a four hour period, and I just couldn't manage making, storing, transporting, and eating all the food every day. Aside from my one clinging vice (potato chips, argh), my diet is very healthy. Lots of greens, minimal oils (no butter), protein, mostly plant-based, whole ingredients, lots of water, no sweets or sugars outside of natural fruit sugar and those from the chips and the occasional rice noodles from my weekly Thai takeout. Even did jogging for a while, and no noticeable differences.

Over time, I realized that I needed to learn to be satiated by smaller portions. I started to eat smaller meals and ate when I was hungry, which started to feel less immediate as months went on. Now, almost two years after trying to actively make a change, I've finally learned how to not make food my crutch and enjoy my healthy, yummy diet without overdoing it. Even with a few chips here and there.

All of a sudden, this Monday, I ate lunch (salmon filet and Brussel sprouts) and was full. Stayed full for a while, kept drinking water (I drink approximately 100 fl oz/3 L a day). I ended up doing an entire 24 hour fast until lunch yesterday and felt great, strong, and well. Another 21 before lunch today. I intend to keep going with an approximate 20:4/OMAD with the occasional full 24 for a while and see where this takes me.

3812,"Why would ""cheat days"" on vacation cause a net LOSS?","I'm stumped and hoping you can help me puzzle this one out!

My normal IF routine is 18:6 six days a week, with OMAD every Sunday. I try to limit bread/cookies/gluten-y stuff because those usually set me back, but I usually eat a piece (or two or three) of chocolate after lunch and/or dinner, and one day a week I have pizza for dinner. I wouldn't say I'd hit a plateau, but things had definitely slowed down lately. (FTR, I'm okay with that slower progress because you'd have to pry that chocolate and pizza from my cold dead hands.)

Then last week, I went on my first vacation since the pandemic (a road trip with my family to Colorado to beat the Texas heat, woo!) and I'm scratching my head over what happened.

First, for some context:

SW in Jun 2019: 142.6

CW (before this vacation): 125.6

GW: 120

While on vacation, I ate SHAMEFULLY -- burgers with fries, Twinkies, cookies, and on and on. But I still did my normal 18:6 for 4 of the days, OMAD on 2 days (back to back), and 16:8 on 2 days when I had McDonald's breakfast on the road. ü§§

Here's the puzzler: Mid-week, I was up 2+ lbs, but the day after I got back, I was DOWN 1 lb, and by the second day of being back on my normal 18:6 schedule, I was down another lb on top of that?!

What could have caused a net loss after all that?

1. Back-to-back OMAD in the middle of the vacation?
2. Free-for-all ""cheat"" meals kickstarting my metabolism? (no idea if that's even a thing, just grasping here)
3. Higher elevation in Colorado? (kidding, unless that \*is\* a thing?!)

...or something else? Or is it just a fluke?

Because if it's not a fluke, I want to understand the reason WHY so that I can try to recreate the effect on our next vacation... üòÜ

3817,Job in catering wrecked my fasting and I can't get back on track. Any tips please?," 

So after 4 months of fasting and good results, I got a job after being unemployed for a year. I got employed as a waitress (again). And it has completely wrecked my fasting and killed my motivation to fast for several reasons.

* Dehydration. I'm a very thirsty person in general. My mouth is frequently dry and I drink quite a lot of water. Summers are sweltering where I live. About 40 celsius with high humidity. Working as a waitress makes me quite thirsty even though I make sure to drink a lot of water. It's like my thirst lasts hours after I finish work and it makes me crave moist things like fruit, salad and ice-cream and I end up eating them just to cool my mouth and satisfy this thirst but not because I'm truly hungry. I'm trying to work one it by at least eliminating the ice cream and consuming fruit instead.
* Eating food at odd hours. Sometimes I serve at weddings and typically few guests want dessert so the dessert goes to the staff which means I'm eating at like midnight. This is while my optimum eating window is lunch time, and I've always found a later eating window impossible to stick to.
* I'm offered food constantly. I technically work two catering jobs, and in each one they give the staff a meal. I end up eating it even if I'm not hungry. I don't want to feel like the odd one out and don't want to upset the cooks by refusing their food. I'm gonna try and work on this by telling them not to make me food.
* I'm surrounded by good food that's going to get wasted. A shameful amount of food gets wasted in catering. Guests order more food than they can stomach and so the staff are encouraged to eat the leftover food that still looks pristine and untouched, or the kitchen many times makes too much food and gives the leftovers to staff. And I feel guilty about all that food going to waste. Like it's not even used for something else or composted it's just thrown in the trash.

Well this experience has really taught me how bad our culture is when it comes to food. I've successfully fasted for months, but when you're constantly surrounded by food, offered food, and seeing food going to waste it really warps your perspective. I mean a friend of mine has forbidden herself from ever working in catering again because being surrounded by food made her binge-eating disorder worse.",intermittentfasting,1625067548

Could this be caused by doing OMAD? I did find some research indicating that fasting can raise uric acid levels. However, I‚Äôm surprised that that alone would trigger gout. I‚Äôve been doing OMAD for ~2 years and 18:4 for about ~2 year before that. 

Also, I eat vegan protein powder daily which is typically pea protein. Perhaps that‚Äôs a contributing factor. 

I probably have 12 drinks a week - primarily wine. I know I can cut that back. But again it seems unlikely to cause gout alone in a health vegan with an active lifestyle.

I've done IF before, but stopped during my thesis writing, so not to be distracted.

I plan to have my first meal during my lunch break, so it will begin my window. Usually infele fine with some black coffee or water un the morning.

My work requires me to oversee a specific area, but it's it's a different area each day, so lunchbreaks differentiate. A collegue rotates between areas, while we are away, so i can't ask for a specific time for my lunch.

3848,Just getting started!,"Hello everyone! 

I've been struggling with how I look for years and my  parents stopping me when I get on a strict diet or myself just giving up haven't really helped. 

Over the last couple months I've been eating once a day and very meagrely. My parents and siblings stepped in and made me stop that which is understandable, even though I loved the weight loss I could tell it wasn't healthy. 

So, after looking for a new diet I stumbled upon IF and loved the concept. Because I used to once a day the fasting part seemed easy so I decided to give it a go, but I have some questions. 

I don't quite know how much to eat when not fasting. Yesterday I had a tortilla with some  chicken and vegetables and then some chicken breast...and that's it. I go out with my friends daily, but I never eat in front of them, just an insecurity of mine I've had for many years. When I came back home I was hungry, my parents told me to have something, but it was late and I didn't want to cheat on my very first day. 

Now, when I would eat once a day I would many times feel exhausted and that's what I felt this morning. I got up to do my morning workout which I completed with struggle and I realised just how tired I was. My summer job involves a lot of moving around and climbing stairs which I also struggled with. I know things are going to get better once my body gets used to the fasting, but what I'm worried about is that I don't eat enough during my eating periods. 

After working out I decided to have some orange juice, not even a glass I just a swig and then put the bottle down. Is that allowed during the fasting? 

My friends and I are not heavy drinkers at all, but we do enjoy the occasional drink. Is alcohol completely prohibited?

I was interested in Keto as well since I heard that it's great and it really helps, but I haven't done a lot of research. 

BTW, totally forgot to mention I'm male, 6'0"" and I turned 16 in June. I really don't care about how much I weigh since I'm fixating on becoming healthier and improving my appearance.

Long -time lurker, first time poster. I was inspired by the countless success stories that are posted here daily, and wanted to share the first milestone of my ongoing fitness journey.

**Starting Date / Weight / Age:** June 28th, 2020 / 201 lbs / 31 Years Old

**Ending Date / Weight / Age:** June 28th, 2021 / 149.9 lbs / 32 Years Old

**IF Timings:**  I started  with 18:6, and increased the fasting window in 2 hour increments, until I got comfortable enough to do OMAD. It took about a week in between each increment for me to feel good  enough to try the next step.

**Calories Consumed:** I tried to eat according to my BMR. I calculated my BMR by using one of the many calculators online. **I didn't treat is as an exact goal to hit, but a guideline of where I should be.** I would typically eat slightly above or below it (\~+/- 150 cals)  There were also some days where I was WAY OVER, due to life happening, but I always made sure to get back on the wagon right after. You can probably see some of those spikes on the graph above.

**Exercises:** For the first 4 months, the only exercising I did was cardio. I started by running 3 miles, and once I could do that, I kicked it up by half a mile, and went from there. Eventually. I found a sweet spot around 7 miles, and did not really feel the need to go beyond that. I did not care about how fast I was going, but only cared about going the distance.

I am doing this to achieve autophagy - (a small amount of weight loss was my gift with purchase). I HAD already lost 11lbs (now 9) doing OMAD and VLCHPHF, adding 36-72 hour fasts specifically for my higher goal. But, at this rate, if I gain weight from not eating anything for 48hrs, the horrific genetics I was hoping to combat (diabetes/cancer/Alzheimer‚Äôs) will likely hit me in the head at any moment.

I am beyond depressed and feeling defeated. Why would this happen? And no, it can‚Äôt just be water - I have been peeing my brains out - lol. There is no more water left in this body‚Ä¶

i started doing 16/8 about a month ago, and already lost about 12 lbs. so right now i weigh around 180.

i am trying to start slowly with exercise, because i have a lot of muscle mass to rebuild. i am also currently switching from being a daily smoker to vaping, which will hopefully make exercising easier by improving my lung capacity. 

i‚Äôm eating a vegetarian diet, no added sugars, trying to stick to things like veggies, fruit, complex carbohydrates, low-fat yogurt, and healthy fats like nuts and olives. i‚Äôm also taking vitamins to make sure i get enough nutrients and don‚Äôt starve my brain, which i need for work. 

the easiest thing to do seems to be skipping breakfast, sticking to black tea in the mornings, so no calories before 12pm and then no calories after 8pm. for the most part, i‚Äôve been able to stick to this routine. 

i‚Äôm wondering how crucial it is that i 100% adhere to a routine, and also hoping to hear from anyone who‚Äôs managed to lose weight gained from similar medications. it seems to do strange things to our metabolism and be particularly hard to lose this kind of weight, but when you do start the pounds literally just melt off (which is how i ended up 125 lbs in 2020). the degree to which my weight has fluctuated in recent years concerns me and seems very unhealthy. i‚Äôm still quite young, but want to make sure i set myself up for a long, healthy life.

9 PM: 14-16 oz chicken breast with an avocado and 2 oz of cheese which comes to roughly 900 calories

Really loved it lost like 35-40 lbs. Was on top of the world. When fall came around I started noticing a feeling less of wanting to commit to the OMAD and to wake up with some breakfast. I love breakfast foods in the fall not sure why but wanting to enjoy those but stick to even a less strict version was tricky to go from easy OMAD to wanting 2 meals a day at like 12 hours apart from each other so never really giving my stomach a rest. Then with winter I just wanted to snack all the time. And with spring it wasn't a huge deal but felt more like a breakfast kinda time and wasn't interested in dinner. Over all I know there's gonna be flexibility with any diet but I thought it was interesting how strong the seasons affected my relationship with food and times to eat. Wondering mostly if anyone else has felt like this and also if you have any advice on how to really tackle it. Due to some stress eating and also feeling out of whack every time the seasons change I ended up putting back 15 of those 40 pounds. I'm thinking of every month doing a little 24-36 hour fast just to rest my timing with food and allow for any seasonal or just life adjustments.,intermittentfasting,1625005258

It‚Äôs been amazing and I‚Äôve lost 10% of my body weight. I‚Äôm noticing over the last week I‚Äôve been finding it hard to stay consistent. I have been having breakfast, or having a glass of wine in the evenings. Last night I snacked in the evening (flatbread and hummus) for the first time since I started in April. I‚Äôve been trying to be kind and not spiral but am worried I‚Äôm making too many allowances. I‚Äôve also plateaued for the past month so maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not seeing those immediate gains.

3905,Calorie intake,"I'm M 19, 175 cms and 80kgs. I do the 16/8 IF. I want to lose fat. My current aim is consuming 2000 calories a day. Is that good enough or should I reduce it even more for a larger deficit?",intermittentfasting,1624996371

3909,Getting rid of (probably?) visceral fat,"Hey everyone, I always had a fairly healthy weight (or BMI of 21-22), but I always have a kind of round belly, as if I'm a passionate beer drinker, which I'm not. I always assumed that this is just my body shape, because if I flex my muscles, the result is a round belly, with round, curved abdominal muscles with a bit of fat tissue in front of that. Recently I theorized that there may be not only fat in front of my abdominal muscles, but also behind it. 

Borrowed content from /r/keto (although I'm not on keto, but rather low carb with 20:4 IF):

&gt; Insulin-driven fat storage seems to deposit fat more in the abdomen than in other locations. This is the so called apple/pear body shape talk you may have heard. Interestingly, visceral fat is more hormonally active than other types of fat and may resist collection, even when the metabolism has been restored to normal function via the cessation of carbohydrate intake. These fat cells secrete hormones called adipokines that interfere with proper glucose tolerance. They are the zombie fat cells that want to eat the brains of your properly-functioning metabolism. 

So \*if\* I have a lot of visceral fat, it seems like that it's particularly hard to burn, am I correct? If I keep a low carb diet with 20:4 IF, and a caloric deficit of about 200-300 kcal a day and light exercise 4x per week, will it eventually burn into visceral fat, or does it require more rigorous measures?",intermittentfasting,1624994767

When I started IF my body stopped being hungry even in the eating window and it was hard to me to eat something - so I focused on eating very caloric foods and MANA. After a week my weight dropped by 5kg which is too much (I normally keep my weight at 53kg when eating a lot). So my point is - is there a way to optimize my diet so I maintain my weight even with IF? Maybe IF is not for me?

Bear with me. 

I am thinking of working up my way into OMAD because it's very effective and I have a lot to lose, and I am good at fasting (not really, never gone beyond 5 days, but I've done it many times), but I love having meals, I love all three of them, I am not even one of those lucky people who don't care for breakfast. I can easily let go of snacks, but that's not enough to make me slim apparently. Now, I think I can push myself into eating once a day, or in a window, for a period, even a lengthy period, even for a couple of years, but if afterwards that ends up being the only way I can stay slim, it's going to be a sure disaster, I'm afraid I will end up re-gaining it all because I can't make that ""change of lifestyle"" permanently.

3928,IF Plateau - How Do I Break Out Of This???,"Hi all - I started IF in mid-April 2021 and over the next 8 weeks lost a little over 20 lbs (started \~210 ¬ª 187 at my lowest). I love it!

Around early June, I hit a plateau. Was seeing 2.5 lbs lost per week before, started seeing pretty much nothing once I hit the high-180's. I was shooting to get down to low 170's, so this was very discouraging.

I probably would have stuck with what I was doing, BUT...I also started having problems with ED (I assume it's ok to mention this as a medical fact - not trying to break any rules for this SR). The funny thing with that is that initially my sex drive increased during IF. I just felt great for those first 6-8 weeks (in a lot of ways).

Well, since my wife was looking great (she had also started IF and lost 10lbs, which neither of us realized she even had to lose), I had to address the ED problem POST-HASTE, and so while not completely stopping IF, I have been experimenting, just trying to find something that works. I started to reintroduce carbs significantly (though not pigging out), and that seems to have helped a lot. The good news is the ED has not been a problem in a few weeks. The bad news is my weight is slowly creeping back up.

So I guess I am just scared that my weight is going to slowly creep back up to where I started.

I lost 80 pounds in exactly 4 months so far with intense willpower, O.M.A.D and no sugar/low carb diets, along with frequent dog walks! 

I am not sure why I am making a post, I am a lurker who does not like to post anything. I am usually anonymous browsing 99% of the time when on here, tbh. I don't want any karma, this is a throwaway. But after fighting my weight all my life, I finally have the willpower to give it my all, and have gained mental control that I have not had before. And wanted to help inspire others do the same!

It has not been easy. I eat once every 24 hours, 7 days a week. No cheat days anymore, nor breaks. No sugar, and I try to keep my carbs under 20 a day. It is hard! But I am not big on number crunching. I do not count calories for the most part, only carbs. I just have gained a new gear in mental fortitude. I have even banned cheat days and feel I no longer need them.. nor days off at all. I lost 25 pounds after 1 month, 43 after 2, 63 after 3, 80 after 4. 

I do use artificial sweeteners. I drink mostly water, but also those water enhancer drops like Mio, diet pop, unsweetened almond milk. Most meals consist of a meat protein with a small amount of vegetables. Sometimes cheese. I am not super heavy on fat like some Keto users, but still incorporate some ofc. I think hot sauce has been great for me. Mad Dog 357 from Hot Ones is my hottest sauce. A small amount hurts your mouth/makes you cry, so be careful! But I like it. And have it often casually as a finale to my meals lol. Many hot sauces have no carbs and low calories, and I like condiments. 

I usually eat my one meal a day around 7 PM right after a long dog walk (right now we go for our walk later at night so he doesn't get too hot. But think excercising right before my 1 meal is the way to go. Despite really feeling it during, sometimes.)

Feel free to ask questions, or give me any tips to increase my speed. Or recommend tasty low carb condiments or something lol.

But after fighting my weight all my life, I finally have the willpower to give it my all, and have gained mental control that I have not had before. And wanted to help inspire others do the same. 

It has not been easy. I eat once every 24 hours, 7 days a week. No cheat days anymore, nor breaks. No sugar, and I try to keep my carbs under 20 a day. But I am not big on number crunching. I do not count calories for the most part, only carbs. I just have gained a new gear in mental fortitude. I have even banned cheat days and feel I no longer need them.. nor days off at all. I lost 25 pounds after 1 month, 43 after 2, 63 after 3, 80 after 4. 

I do use artificial sweeteners. I drink mostly water, but also those water enhancer drops like Mio, diet pop, unsweetened almond milk. Most meals consist of a meat protein with a small amount of vegetables. Sometimes cheese. I am not super heavy on fat like some Keto users, but still incorporate some ofc. I think hot sauce has been great for me. Mad Dog 357 from Hot Ones is my hottest sauce. A small amount hurts your mouth/makes you cry, so be careful! But I like it. And have it often casually as a finale to my meals lol. Many hot sauces have no carbs and low calories, and I like condiments. 

I usually eat my one meal a day around 7 PM right after a long dog walk (right now we go for our walk later at night so he doesn't get too hot. But think excercising right before my 1 meal is the way to go. Despite really feeling it during, sometimes.)

Feel free to ask questions, or give me any tips to increase my speed. Or recommend tasty low carb condiments or something lol. 

I might upload progress pics one day. I am an introvert who doesn't like having my picture taken/posting it. But might feel like doing so one day.

3981,OMAD restrictions?,"So I am doing 17:7 right now, but I usually end up going 18-23 hours in between instead of just the 17.

I study after work when I work mornings so the typical IF of skipping breakfast and eating lunch and dinner doesn't seem optimal for my needs.

4002,Experienced IF'r with a question,"Hi all - 

I've been successfully IFing for a while - long time 16:8 to 20:4, pretty close to goal weight but still working on body composition. Two recent experiences have me scratching my head a bit.

1. My wife also does IF, and wanted to do a 36hr fast a week or two ago. I did it with her. It was not hard, no crazy hunger, did some light workouts, etc. We broke our fast very carefully progressing from broth, to fermented food, to veggies, to protein.
2. Today I was going for 20:4 and just got busy, so it ended up being about 23. Again, no problems - not lightheaded or even hungry. Broke my fast with ground beef and taco meat.

After the 36, I felt really lousy for almost a day and a half. Felt like the flu - achy in every joint and very tired. Same thing after the 23 today but not as severe (and hopefully not as long!).

Anyone have a guess (AND NOT MEDICAL ADVICE) about what's going on? The only think I can think is either I'm triggering some inflammation or else some adrenal fatigue. I know the obvious answer is don't fast so long, which is fine. But it bothers me that it bothers me - lol. TIA for any ideas. Cheers!",intermittentfasting,1627949823

4032,Tried OMAD for a month...,"I just came off of my first (and probably last) 30 days of OMAD and I wanted to list some of the reasons why I concluded this wasn't the IF schedule for me. 

1. I was really, really hungry and this led to some not so great actions/choices.
2. I started craving really calorie dense foods. Pizza, pasta, ice cream, you name it, the more caloric the food the more I wanted it. I was absolutely not paying attention to nutrition.
3. I ate too fast. I was so hungry that I don't think I even chewed my food properly. I'd down 1200 calories worth of food in like 20 minutes and felt completely miserable afterwards for hours. 
4. I didn't lose that much weight. I don't know the exact results of this experiment because I don't own a scale and only measure myself once a month. But I lost maybe a single cm from my chest, waist and hips, respectively. Which is not that different from my usual progress while doing 20:4.

In conclusion: OMAD is certainly not for me. 

I gave it a good try and it's just not worth it for me personally. I wanted to share this so that others who have tried and failed OMAD like I did will be reassured that it's totally ok to go back to a shorter fasting window if a longer one is not working for you. 

I'll still throw in an OMAD day or two every once in a while, just to challenge myself. But I don't think I'll try sustaining it for longer periods of time again. Honestly, those of you who can actually do OMAD correctly are impressive as heck.",intermittentfasting,1627919312

I often see intermittent fasting forums and guides recommending NOT to break a fast in the evening, and sleep on the full stomach. I understand the logic behind that, but the primary argument is because it ruins that golden opportunity to burn fat while you sleep. 

However, if I break the fast at the same time, and I‚Äôm active when I‚Äôm awake instead of sleeping, doesn‚Äôt it make since that I burn more fat during the day, than I would if I were to save my sleeping window for my ‚Äú primary fat loss ‚Äú? 

I have an active job where I‚Äôm moving at least 6+ hours of the day, walking and or moving objects. When I don‚Äôt work, and even sometimes when I do work, I love to lift weights for 45+mins and do heavy cardio for 20+ mins. 

It makes sense to me I‚Äôd actually burn more fat being fasted, and forcing my body to use the only energy it has which is fat, to push me through these workouts.

SW: 87 kgs. CW: 78 kgs. GW: 54-56 kgs.
A total of 9 kgs lost in a month. Some of it unhealthily, as evidenced in the linked post, others due to slowing my pace down to be more sustainable. 


*Type of fast:* IF (and calorie deficit of ~300-400 kcals each day) regular eggetarian, and trying to incorporate low to medium carbs, high veggie content, soups, salads and smoothies.


*Context:* Day 3. Began July 31. To go on until I reach the healthy body weight range for my almost Hobbit height of 5""1' :)


*Length of fast:* Famous last words, anybody? I had so naively and incorrectly mentioned in my previous post that I wasn't going to do this. But, I'm currently on 20:4 - all days of the week. 


I call it ""cheat"" OMAD (basically eat off and on for 4 hours in the morning until I reach at least 1200 Kcals! I'm not too picky yet, as long as I reach the minimum required calorie requirement. Further context in  notes.)


*Why?* I weighed 87 kgs at my heaviest. Diabetes and other health issues are rampant in my family. At 32 years(F), I was running out of time to reverse the damage caused by years of neglecting my health. It finally took a close family member being diagnosed - who had led a similar lifestyle as me - to committing to making and sticking with changes. 


*Notes:* (recap of month 1 i.e. July 2021 - I had originally stated IF on 30th June (16:8 in week 1 of July, then 18:6 for half of week 2) along with eggetarian keto, which was causing calorie deficit in any case. However, I ended up severely undereating during the eating period (some days I barely reached 900 Kcal - mostly stayed between 800-850) 


Which *obviously* signalled that I had ruined my metabolism. Side effects included undeserved muscle and joint soreness, of all things. I hadn't even worked out to have earned it! So, on the day I found I had eaten only ~750 Kcal, I broke keto, ate some carbs and decided to stop IF until I was done with 1 month of keto. I followed the advice given by commenters on the original post that if something doesn't work, modify it, just don't stop or quit. I'm glad to say I haven't. Yet ;)


Now that I'm done with keto - decided to stop after 1 month, rather than 2, I started the 20:4 IF. I am not controlling my portions per se, but my lessened appetite due to keto is helping me staying full even if I use a smaller plate. 


I plan to restart walking 10k-12k steps sometime this or the next week (had started in January and was just hitting my stride - when the Rona cases started increasing in my country!) So I've ordered  protein and Collagen powder to add to my fruits and berry smoothie post workout. Between that and eggs on whole wheat toasted bread, I'd be able to limit my intake of too much carbs.


So, as of now the 20:4 is going well. I don't feel like I'm very hungry in the middle of the day unlike how it got when I just started Keto. So that's helping. There's always water and green tea available to drink just to help. Oh, and I was on multivitamins, vit c and zinc supplements already because I wasn't getting much of those micronutrients in my diet. 


If anybody can offer any suggestions regarding food or vitamins/minerals, I'd be grateful to hear them.

4052,Best time to work out on OMAD?,"Hiya!

I am new to this forum but not particulary new to OMAD or IF. 2 years ago prior to the pandemic, I fell into OMAD as a result of keto adaptation. I was in ketosis and whenever I hit ketosis, typically, I loose my appetite, sleep better, wake up early and just feel my very best. (My issue when it relates to keeping the momentum or progression has been rewarding myself during small wins and blowing my progress. Add in the pandemic and I am back at square 1). When I fell into OMAD 2 years ago, it was easy because I had been in ketosis for 3 solid weeks. But I did not exercise during that time. I was simply burning around the clock. 

I lost 17 lbs in one month after falling into OMAD and felt great. Needless to say, I have gained that back, plus more. So I want to probably start with 2MAD and work my way up to OMAD. 

My question with that would be, when would I work out prior to my meal? Should I save the calorie burn to just prior to my meal at around 6 or 7 in the evening? What have you found is the sweet spot as it relates to HIIT, jump roping or jogging and OMAD.

4069,Dear people who tell you off for skipping meals. Go away!,"I started fasting a few months ago to loose some weight and gain some confidence back, I am nearly down 10kgs and feeling great!

But one of my biggest bug bears with this is people who notice your weight loss or that you haven't eaten (I am on OMAD at the moment) and ask you about it and then give their opinion or other dieting options because ""skipping meals isn't healthy"".

I have found I have more energy and have found a diet I can stick too so what is the problem? I just hate it when everyone feel like they have the authority to comment on your body or dieting. I have done the research and what I am doing is not unhealthy or risky.

The worst is people who when you say no thanks when food is offered (which can sometimes be hard enough as is) then insist ""oh a little slice of cake won't hurt"".

The 36 hour mark was still ok. By the last 4 hours, I think I reached my limit, I was feeling suddenly weak and got veeery hungry.  I pushed through and made it to the 48 hours, broke my fast with some pea protein and a couple of rice cakes, waited an hour and a half and had a generous bowl of Pho.

I controlled my craving and didn't binge, I felt very full after the Pho, however I was feeling quite weak when I was eating. I am not sure if this is normal or a bad sign?

4088,"Trying to get back into IF, having a hard time.","I started doing IF on the 1st of April this year, typically 16:8 with the odd 20:4 to mix things up. I started off really well, lost almost two stone (approx 12kg) and then went *completely* off plan. I had to write my dissertation with time running out, a little over a month of crazy stress levels and comfort eating... (did shares in Cadbury's rise in the month of June, it feels like they should've!) Needless to say I ended up piling a good amount of weight on, a stone in total. Undoing half of the hard work I put in earlier.

I've felt my clothes getting tighter again, and made an effort today to really get back into things. Started with 20mins of cardio this morning and broke my fast at 11am. My biggest issue atm is resisting the call to snack every few hours... I'm an absolute bugger for nuts and I find myself drawn to the cupboard more often than I'd like to admit.

Any advice for beating those snack cravings? I can manage the fast in the morning, but it's the rest of the day I'm having issues with; especially on days when I'm stuck indoors with nothing much to do or later in the evening. Just feel like I'm missing the same drive I had when I first discovered IF earlier in the year.

4098,How long does it typically take you to enter ketosis during a fast?,"I've been an IFer for quite a long time, probably on and off now for nearly a decade. It's always done me well to keep my weight in check. 

Until now. I (male, early 40s, have been lifting and doing martial Arts most of my life) thought it was just a combination of things; stress and lack of sleep, family pressure, etc etc, recently. And I'm aware that they certainly ARE contributing to my slowly going backwards weight wise. But I fast 20-21 hours a day and don't honestly have time to consume a large surplus.

So anyway, I went and bought myself some ketostix to test how many ketones are in my blood stream after 20-21 hours of no calories... And the answer is 0 apparently. I tested multiple times after each fast, and unless they are all defective I am not in ketosis at all.

I have two black coffees a day and one nodoze in the morning (not great I know but I'm getting very little sleep at the moment due to a new family edition :)). I'm honestly stumped, I've never tested myself before, but all the literature I've read says I should be producing ketones after 12-14 hours.

I guess the question is is it ok for me to essentially do a 24 hour fast from tonight, have dinner as normal and then not eat again until dinner before I leave for work? Essentially flipping my window so I can eat midway through the night shift when I'm flagging energy-wise. Will that wreck my metabolism?

Also, when I'm on the early shifts would it be better to maintain my window no matter what or even flex it forward or back an hour or two as needed? Then when I'm off work I can just fast a little longer the next day to get back into the cycle?

Hit a plateau about 5 weeks ago, and cannot get past it. M-F. 

How did you get past yours? I'm recovering from an ankle injury, so exercise is pretty non-existent right now. 

I'm happy with the progress over the last few months, even though I'm usually hungry, and my brain completely gives out around 2-3pm. I have to watch my iron intake, so I can't eat tons of meat or to many leafy greens (sucks, because greens are my absolute favorite).

Im at the weight I always get stuck at- haven't been able to get below 155 in years. 

MWF- one snack at 3pm, usually 15olives or a handful of nuts, dinner is lean meat and veg.

T/TH- lunch is salad (lettuce/raw veg/ sometimes a boiled egg and homemade salad dressing), dinner is lean meat and veg. 

Sat/Sun- usually do one breakfast taco at 9am, and fish/shrimp with veg for dinner.

67M, 5‚Äô8‚Äù, SW 237, CW 185, GW - 175. IF 18/6

Just wanted to document where things stand after 1 year of quite consistent IF. 

Down 52 lbs. Moved from 44-inch pants to 36-inch. I'm 10 lbs. from my goal weight, but summer vacation is not helping -- too much unstructured time. I was hoping to get back to the gym now that I'm fully vaccinated, but with the surge in COVID Delta variant cases that have come with the Olympics here in Japan, I've decided to ride it out at home. Did manage to get a haircut after roughly a year.

After several months of slow loss and mounting frustration, I added a low carb diet to the mix this past month. That seems to have worked pretty well as I tripled my weight loss compared with the previous four months. I'm really looking forward to what the next two or three month will bring.",intermittentfasting,1627736053
4139,Timing of Daily Protein Intake can Affect Muscle Growth - concentrating protein intake in the morning (rather than evening) yields greater increases in muscle size and function,"Researchers from Waseda University in Japan have found that concentrating protein intake in the morning yields greater increases in muscle size and function than concentrating protein intake in the evening for humans. 

&gt; The reason behind this is the body‚Äôs internal biological clock, called  the ‚Äòcircadian rhythm.‚Äô This rhythm is followed by all cells and  controls life functions like metabolism and growth. Interestingly,  protein digestion and absorption have been found to fluctuate across day  and night according to this clock. 

Lay article: [https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/news/74633](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/news/74633)

Quotes from one of the study authors Prof. Shigenobu Shibata:

&gt; ‚Äú*Protein-rich diet at an early phase of the daily active period,  that is at breakfast, is important to maintain skeletal muscle health  and enhance muscle volume and grip strength*.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt; ‚Äú*For humans, in general, the protein intake at breakfast averages  about 15 grams, which is less than what we consume at dinner, which is  roughly 28 grams. Our findings strongly support changing this norm and  consuming more protein at breakfast or morning snacking time.‚Äù*

The study had two parts: tests on mice and tests on sixty (human) women over the age of 65. The group of senior women who ate a greater proportion of protein in the morning (vs the evening) showed greater increases in muscle mass, skeletal muscle index, and hand grip strength.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I'm a big fan of daily time restricted eating (aka ""daily I.F."") There are a lot of questions and misunderstandings out there about which eating window to pick. 

There's already a large body of evidence that an early eating window (breaking fast within a few hours of waking up at latest) is optimal for a lot of people. For instance, we're more much more insulin sensitive in the morning vs the afternoon and evening. So, hopefully this study adds another piece to the puzzle that helps folks select the best eating window for them.",intermittentfasting,1627729523
4147,Question regarding exercise and IF,"Hi All,

My partner has just begun 16/8 IF. She is 44, 175cm and 62kg. She‚Äôs not interested in weight loss, just maintenance, but does have a history of bulimia and wants to curb any snacking tendencies.

Mainly, her question is regarding exercise. She works out 6-7 times a week, between 30-60 minutes per time, mostly intense cardio but also resistance training a couple of times a week. Her best time to workout is before 8.00am, but her fast would end around 11.15am. Do any of you have experience of waiting this long after training to eat?

However in two out of the last three days I had an issue where about two hours after breaking my fast, my stomach starts to feel extremely bloated to the point of very bad pain. The pain is enough that I'm practically writhing, I can't really focus on anything other than the discomfort, and I'm pouring sweat. It feels just like a bad gas build up in my stomach, and it only lasts for about 20-30 minutes, then rapidly just disappears and I feel fine. Has anybody else experienced this?  


For more info: 

Maybe I'm just pushing myself too hard, too fast, but I genuinely feel great lately, and like I said it has just happened today, and Wednesday. I'm wondering if it's re-feeding syndrome? In addition to essentially OMAD fasting (usually between 20-24 hrs fasting) I also cut out tons of sugar and a fair amount of carbs from my diet. I used to get sugary vending machine snacks, and like a 20oz bottle of soda or an energy drink every day. As of July 1st I have had nothing to drink but water, and no junk food whatsoever. As a result, calories have been cut drastically also. 

I try to break my fast with a small amount of food (today it was popcorn because I went to see the Green Knight at noon which is about when I break my fast) and then ate a meal about 2.5 hrs later after the movie was over. I'm just wondering if this is a diet related issue, or something else.",intermittentfasting,1627693777

However, I love to drink. I love it guys. I‚Äôve cut back *significantly*, especially when I switched from night shift to day shift, but I don‚Äôt know that I would want to give it up completely. 

I‚Äôm just starting and I do need to lose weight. 

Is it feasible to lose weight without cutting out alcohol completely? I can easily drink a bottle of wine in a sitting, which I know is bad, but only happens 1-2 times a week (sporadically - not every week)

I feel like it's been better since I switched to low carb, and also maybe slightly better if I eat over my maintenance calories the day before, but I cant seem to make sense of why some days I feel substantially less energy.  On all fasting days I never have quite the same burst or reserve energy as if I was carboloading, but that's to be expected.   I use electrolyte replacement powder, and that seems to help as well, I sleep 8 hours a night,  but there are just still days where I just feel like I dont have it.

The problem is, when I eat the same amount of food in a meal that I ate before, I feel so full now I want to puke. The weirdest part is that before I would probably go for seconds and it's not such a big amount. 

Just for context, my lunch was spicy black beans (200g) with ground beef (200g) and white rice (200g) (I usually prefer brown, but it was the available option today). Then I drank half a glass of water and ate a tiny banana and cinnamon cookie for desert (this one was overkill because I didn't even want it, I don't know why I did that). This is usually my biggest meal of the day, for breakfast is either simple protein or a mug of skim milk and coffee and maybe 3 cookies when I feel like cheating a bit.

As such, I don't have control over when I work out/practice. We practice 9 times a week for 2 hours each, three times in the morning and six times in the afternoon. 

I'm really struggling because IF has been the only diet to work for me in the past, but I have no idea if its possible on this current workout plan. I absolutely cannot go into practice fasted, even morning practice- i'm most hungry in the mornings, and each practice involves 1-1.5 hours of straight cardio that I need to perform well in. I've tried for the past two months to just focus on CICO and try to eat in moderation, but it's not going very well at all.  I know that IF has worked for me, but I just can't figure out how to make it work. I don't really care at all about hormone optimization, so I would consider fasting in the middle of the day (so essentially just skipping lunch). 

On days when we just have one practice, I'll do 16/8 cause practice being in the evening makes it easy. For double days, though, I'm considering something like this: wake up around 5:30 or 6, breakfast. finish practice at 8:30am. feeding window open until 9:30, then open feeding window from 3:30-8:30 to allow for pre- and post-practice fueling? does that sound feasible at all?

(The reason I want to try 16:8 is to lose weight and maybe make it easier to stick to a 1200calorie regimen. My thought was to try it during the week and not during the weekend.)  


1. Is breakfast the most important meal of the day? I always thought so. I've also read that people who eat breakfast maintain a healthier weight than people who don't. How does that line up with IF as a healthy choice?

4192,Wanted to share my progress for those interested over 2 years.,"Haven't really posted here but this place was a valuable resource when I started making changes.  So I thought I would also post my story for people because reading these helped me when I started making changes.   I started about 2 years ago in summer of 2019 after realizing I had moved solidly into middle age and had gotten a typical dad bod and more.    I was 43 then and probably high 210-220, had a 34"" waist and have moved into a men's large in clothing.   At 5'8"" that put me solidly overweight and borderline obese.    The first thing i started was intermittent fasting and only eating between 12-8pm.    It was slow at first but I realized that without making many other changes I had lost a significant amount of weight by the spring of 2020.   I never owned a scale so got one to track and when I started weighing myself I was 195.    From there I fell pretty consistently over the summer to 175 and that plateaued a bit over the fall and winter but then started down again in Spring and now summer of 2021.   I am now 45 (turning 46 in a couple months) and weight 158 pounds.   I have a 30 inch waist and am now wearing a men's small and even sometimes XS.     That puts me back where I was when I was in my early 20s.    

For me most of what I achieved was learning to control my eating.  I was eating far more food then I needed to.   I got away with it when I was younger but like many as I aged it just became harder and harder to keep eating like that and keep the weight off.  I would try working out longer and longer and do 2-3 hour bike rides.   Realized that I was just fighting myself.    Needed to get the correct amount of calories.    Now I do work out but I tend to do shorter more high duration workouts as I don't need to do as much to be in great shape. 

What I have come to learn is that much of what we call middle age is self inflicted.    By the time I hit my peak weight in 2019 I had also started to get all the normal ailments that you get in old age.   I hope no one minds but I am going to tell it like it is.    I had all the aches and pains older people complain about - joints, back, shoulders.    I had developed hemorrhoid's for the first time in my life.    I had started to notice that sexy time stuff was getting harder (or not as it may be).   And I chalked much of that up to just age.    But since I have reduced my weight much of those issues are gone.    We don't need to think we can't anymore just because we are in our mid 40s.    I honestly never thought I could achieve what I have at my age.    And much of that is because on the fasting.    Here is picture I took a couple days ago of myself.   Hopefully it will inspire others that anything you put your mind to is possible even if you are 40+",intermittentfasting,1627651685

4207,Question,"Hello
So I have been fasting for the past two years. My fast is about 12-14 hours , where I only eat between 10-6. 
Two months ago I had a bad panic attack for the first time in my life and since then my whole health has felt like a wreck even though all my diagnostic tests came back normal.
I started dealing with indigestion and heartburn it felt like a couple days after my panic attack and has been coming on and off 

So about 3 Days ago I went to the ER because I was having lower abdomen pain and back pain. They ran blood work, urinalysis and ct scan. Turns out I was just constipated. 
I pooped the past couple days (a lot) and now at night when I lie down I get indigestion feeling and I get burning sensations in my lower abdomen regions near my hip sides and it makes me nauseous, especially laying down.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just soreness ? Or maybe a diet thing ?
I don‚Äôt eat for 3-4 hours before bed and am in good health and eat a healthy diet.
I usually sleep with my head propped up as well. 
The only things that have changed is that i just started a high potency probiotic within the past week, and eating higher fiber diet since the ER visit 
I was wondering anyone else who fasts deals with things similar to this? Again I had no issues before until recently.

I've thrown in a couple of slightly longer fasts - one of 42 hours, and I'm 34 hours into a fast now. I'll probably break my fast in about 6 hours at lunchtime, or I might hold out for dinner, it depends on what happens at work. (There's way too many meetings there!)

Hunger has never really been a problem since I started fasting, even now after 34 hours I'm genuinely not hungry. In that sense, I could go for longer on this fast, or do extended fasts more regularly.

*Except* I really miss food! Planning, cooking and eating dinner is such a big part of my day and I really really love it! I live in a foodie household, and we have really interesting food. 

I know that for some people, one of the best things about extended fasting is that they no longer have to spend so much time in the kitchen and eating. That's the very worst bit of it for me. 

I'll still do the occasional extended fast, and maybe use those evenings to prepare something marinated or something for the following night.

I see the people that post progress pics here and how they've been doing it for 30 days as well and they have much more significant change.

I do 18:6, though I usually push it out to 20h or more since I don't closely watch my end time. I eat 1-2 times after that depending how late I push it out, then brush my teeth after and start fasting again. The portions are small from what I make for dinner and if my SO wants to go out to eat, I try to take at least half home (if it's a large portion) and don't eat till we go to the restaurant. I don't drink anything but water when I'm fasting, I'm careful when I brush my teeth to not swallow anything that might be sugar, but that's the only thing I do when I'm fasting. I tried tea once but bottled unsweet never tastes good to me and I don't have an ice tea maker atm. I do struggle with drinking enough water but I've always had this issue even before trying IF. ‚Äã

I've only broken my fast early a couple times due to extreme period pain with cravings (about 16h in) but I push out so often I figured it would balance out.

It's fascinating!

You can see from my 132-hour fast in week 7, weight loss is dramatic but unsustained, and takes weeks to get back to a downward trend. (I did the fast for other reasons, like immune renewal, reducing inflammation, and finally answering the question, yes, my body hates dairy.)

From my 42-hour fast in week 11, there is a modest decrease that seems to not have a huge impact one way or another.

My 68-hour fast in week 14 seems (at least initially) to have had the best results. A fairly large weight loss, that at least has sustained for one week.

On the keto side, you can see the flushing glycogen stores in week 1, and the weeks after of keto adaptation (in which weight loss seems to ""stall"" while the body switches to ketones as a fuel.)

I like this chart because it also shows the oscillating nature of weight loss; that it's not linear, not constant, not guaranteed from week to week, but the overall trend is down if you're in a caloric deficit (however you achieve it).

It also shows that eating higher carb on a single day doesn't have to be ruinous to the entire WOE. I'm sure you can pick out which week I had more carbs. :)

Has anyone else experimented with lengths of fasting? Have you noticed any trends? What's your best fast length?",intermittentfasting,1633202030

4290,Strict diet with omad and 16:8 Havent lost weight in weeks. What am I doing wrong?,"Title says most of it. I keep gaining and losing the same 2 pounds with little to no progress. It's very frustrating and makes me want to throw in the towel.

Every morning water and black coffee only. No lunch. Get home at 3pm and have a low calorie meal. Usually low calorie soup like veggie or meat that's 120-200 cals. Then eat my big meal of the day at 6 or 7pm which is usually high fat and protein of like homemade burgers, chicken and greek salad, a casserole with a veggie side dish, homemade chili or whatever. Usually pretty healthy and meets my calorie limit of the day of ~1300 ish calories.

 I only do a little different on the weekends which I go out to Denny's for breakfast every saturday with my family but get the fit slam of eggs and turkey bacon which is 450 cals. I cant get out of this because it's the only time I get to see my family. Then I just skip lunch and eat a lighter dinner but it should be fine if I eat a few hundred calories more one day a week?

Newish though I was loosely doing 16:8. 44F, BMI in the ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô range, no great desire to lose much but wouldn‚Äôt mind losing a little to give me a little wiggle room for when menopause hits; mostly concerned about overall health but especially bone health, strength, flexibility etc. My dr said IF was fine for me to do. I‚Äôm trying to aim at two big, obviously very healthy meals a day. 

My old diet was approximately oatmeal plus hemp/flax/banana, sandwich, and some sort of balanced dinner e.g. Buddha bowl, or salmon plus potatoes/veggies. I think that was too much carbs/fiber though so I‚Äôm scaling that back just a tad. To avoid weight gain I aim at 1600 calories a day, and if I exercise enough that can result in weight loss if I feel the need, if I‚Äôve gained a couple of pounds (like recently I was sick and couldn‚Äôt exercise) Even after a day or so, I feel great (IBS-D wise), after decades of misery. But, the hunger is also pretty miserable in a different way. 

I‚Äôm also used to eating smaller meals so  now I‚Äôm hungry/sluggish or stuffed/sluggish‚Ä¶. Maybe I need smaller but higher calorie recipes‚Ä¶.

Around the beginning ofJuly I had a strange loss in my appetite for reasons I'm not really sure about, but I was inadvertently going OMAD and noticing some weight loss after a month. I'm estimating I was probably in the 255-260 range at the time, and had dropped to 244. I decided to try and turn this into something positive, so I took the habits I formed and tried to structure them a little more. I've kept my caloric intake as low as I can without bad(1000 is my low end break point, so I aim for 1000-1500.) As of 2 months since my initial weigh in and going all out with this, I'm down to 222. I'm starting to feel better mentally than I have in years.

Ultimately I'd like to hit 200 by the end of winter next year(maybe even the end of this year but I suspect my weight loss will start leveling off before then), and hopefully stick with it long enough to be able to go swimming again next summer without feeling self conscious in a bathing suit!

I think past diets have failed by virtue of me being an extremely picky eater. Anything remotely bitter I have a lot of trouble with, and I'm pretty sensitive to texture as well. I'm still eating what I normally do, but just controlling my appetite a lot more. I know it's not ideal, but it's been a good compromise rather than giving up on another diet completely.

I have fallen on and off of the keto diet multiple times because while its definitely an easy plan to follow life gets the best of everyone every once and a while.

4334,Today I had a cheat day - What I learnt and what I ate,"I do OMAD every single day (normally on the keto diet) and sometimes I fast for some days straight. 

I had been thinking about having a 'cheat' day (if you can call it that) for some time now, meaning I wouldn't pay as much attention to my calorie intake and eating window. I decided to do this to kickstart my metabolism again as I think it has started slowing down a little bit.

Before telling you what I ate, let me tell you what I learned today.

1. **Change what you eat, not only when you eat.** I'm not saying to cut off everything you love - that's a recipe for disaster. However, try to find some replacements. It's quite easy actually. For example, instead of eating mangoes, why not some strawberries? Just as delicious and way fewer calories and carbohydrates!
2. **A healthy lifestyle stays with you forever.** My new healthy habits are here to stay. Every time I would consider eating something, I would always consider if it was healthy or not. With all the changes I made to my diet, even when I'm cheating I found a way to have meals that are WAY healthier and more delicious than ever! You'll see I also ate some really unhealthy things today, but even when I did that, I was completely conscious of what I was doing, how bad it was and how it REALLY was just an exception (and not the door to go back to old habits).

So, let's go to the food:

As always (before IF), I started eating at Lunch. I then had a snack during the afternoon and finally dinner.

**Lunch:** 

* **Starter:** A small salad with apple cider vinegar before the main dish to control the blood sugar spike that would follow with the main dish. 
* **Main Course:** Roast beef with mushrooms, rice and french fries. 
* **Dessert:** Two sugar-free natural yoghurts with 2 cups of Whey Chocolate Protein and some strawberries, blueberries and raspberries mixed in.

**Afternoon Snack:**

* A cup of Colored Slush. A friend of mine invited me to try this drink out at a posh candy store near her job. As you can imagine, it probably had tons of sugar added in.

**Dinner:**

* **Main Course:** A pizza (half Hawaiian and half Portuguese) ordered from an Italian restaurant.
* **Dessert:** One sugar-free natural yoghurt with 1 cup of Whey Chocolate Protein and some blueberries and raspberries mixed in.

I plan to make a post like this to every cheat day I might have to, at least, document what I eat on cheat days and to ensure I don't go crazy with it hahaha.

[Me at peak](https://imgur.com/a/uDWpo4W) (doesn't show much but I dont click too many pictures, i.e. it's one of the only ones I have)

**And then the shit hit the fan**. Some preface: I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months before I started IF (A bit late in my teens but I was relieved to know the THING, the cause that made me fail at shit so often, it still wasn't an excuse - just a reason). And to have been able to go 80 days without faltering in my convictions was something that made me twice as positive about my life. My confidence level was highest that it had been in years.

**1st Dec, 2020** \- Went to my first cousin's wedding for 7 days or so. And it was an Indian wedding so I was in a hotel for a week with a dozen other cousins and we were having crazy fun and I thought, ""It *IS* just a week, let's just have fun without worrying about any shit."" And well, as you can guess, ADHD kicked in and before I could get my mojo back, the dates of the examination for admission into Engineering Unis were announced and that just put me under immense pressure (It's a huge fucking deal, make or break the next 60 years of your life) and I just forgot about IF. 

Until a couple weeks ago, I was done with my admission exams (got into my dream Uni btw, yayyy). And so here I am, trying to document this journey or whatever and hoping against hope that this time I'll see it through.

I bought the digital scale because that is what my Drs office uses and I like that it tells me, muscle mass, water weight, protein, calories I should now have etc. 

Just venting on the difference and who knows which  one is correct. I do know my large yoga pants are definitely way too big. I had to buy a few medium pants for running especially for the winter months.

I was worried about not counting calories and kind of assumed this would mean I would just eat way more calories during my feeding windows, but that hasn't happened. I feel like this is something I could really stick to and I'm quite hopeful about it.

Green tea seems to have a slightly better reputation but that's what I've personally observed.

4387,The start of my IF journey with 14:10,"Hello, 
Just recently i decided to embrace my full covid recovery and start losing my abdominal weight gain i gained in the last year of not being able to do much exercise - else my heavy physical work in manufacturing (but used to be a gym bunny, 5 times a week for years). Yeah i know i don't look like i went to the gym ever.

Tbh I am an huge snacker, meanwhile i don't eat that unhealty - rarely out and junk. I just have gained so much weight since i stoped taking my contaceptive pills and combined with covid that ruined my lungs for some months. I had a very blurry lung scan in February and now last week i found out that it finally had clear out so i feel enthusiastic about this method.

I'm 30 y/o, 167cm tall and weighted 62.2kgs on the first day (need to lose about 7kgs). Sorry, for being European and using the metric system hehe. My eating window is from 10AM-8PM. I have to eat at my only work break at 10AM or I won't eat till 2PM when i get home and i'm usually starving when i wake up. I'm a breakfast person i can't have it since i work at 6AM every morning. This made me snack at work a lot before i came to my 10AM meal. Also no drinking after 8PM on weekends is going to do massive things since we regulary have drinks in the late evenings on the weekends playing board games. 
I also did a big cut on drinking soda, sugar and candy. My coworkers eat those mjnt candies the whole day it's like a drug lmao, they keep offering me some and i keep declining. I also have a busy job, 2 jobs actually but i'll put my mua work aside for some time so i can get my health and my body back in order. 
Also stress is a massive factor here: in this year i got engaged and we got a huge loan to get our dream apartment which will be done in a week and it's time for me to get my shit together. I also got my fiance to fast with me and he is also already on a diet and goes to the gym now when they're open here. 
I'm so happy i joined the community here and i hope you'll accept me even thought i'm not obese or overweight, i would just like to feel better and accepted, i know i don't look overweight but i really dislike the look of my body atm and i don't feel good in it. I want to tone it and get healthy.

I came here to ask questions: 
Do you think 16:8 would work better? But i need to adapt to the 14:10 first... how long should i keep doing it before i change it? :)

Is sugarfree anything gonna cause the fast to break? 

What can i put into my water to spice it up? 

Can I have chewing gum while on a fast? 

Is green or black tea okay while fasting? Honey bad to sweeten it?
I have a sweet tooth for honey in my tea ugh lol.

Good meals to keep you full for longer and recipes for it?

Some notes: I rarely, rarely drink beer, and I DO plan on counting the calories in MFP for the beers I have tonight. I really am sticking to just two, mostly because they are high in calories and because my tolerance is likely down from what it used to be. Drinking hard seltzer or just water tonight is not an option. I know if I do this often it will be much harder to lose weight, so I wonder if it's okay to cheat just this once.

I also am interested in the modification in which you eat up to 500 cals on the fasting day; but how is this even called ADF, if you're breaking fast- wouldn't this sacrifice the health and weight-loss benefits? (I'm a super strict water faster and into the autophagy and insulin response)

But researching and reading about this ""diet"" assured me how beneficial it is and trying it I found out how easy it is.

It changed my whole daily routine for the better, I feel very energetic, no stomach aches anymore, I feel light all the time and it is amazing. Also best part - no need to think about my next meal all the time. I am always confident in knowing that at 5 pm I am having the best meal I can make, and I really do put in time and effort in making it. No more junk and meals full of only carbs, but I really make sure I get enough of everything. All home cooked, all prepared with love. 

Oh and also - who knew exercising while fasting is possible?! And even easier? I am not used to not having stomach aches all the time so I am thrilled about running on an empty stomach.

4422,The recollection of a newbies first 30 days.,"I hope this finds those looking for inspiration or ideas and what to expect when trying intermittent fasting.  For starters I went from eating whatever whenever and no exercise at all.  I had peaked and held about 300 lbs as a 6' 2"" male.  The heaviest I have ever been.  It should also be noted that when starting IF at the beginning of the month I started a ""100 miles in a month"" challenge, which equated to me running anywhere from 1 to 6.5 miles a day.

The first week I call the purge where you lose like 5 lbs instantly because of the junk flushing out of your system and the restricted eating that your body was used to.  Then another week and a half goes by and no weight loss or gain which I figured is my body building muscle for the running i have been doing.

I didn't count calories or go keto.  I just simply was mindful of what i was eating.  I went from 2-3 pops a day to 4 for the month.  I broke my fast ahead of schedule 4 times.  Two of those times was simply a piece of bread for a quick fuel up before a longer run.  One other was my sleep schedule being a mess and i wasn't able to sleep the majority of my fasting window like i normally would do.  I work rotation so this was tricky.  The last was this morning in celebration for the progress I made with my run completion and the weight I have lost.

All in all 16:8 fasting window that changed with my work schedule and my running i was able to lose almost 18lbs in 30 days.

If you take anything from this,  Its okay to fail (break your fast) and try again the next day.  Its possible to lose without going to extremes with dieting.  Don't loose your sanity depriving yourself of something sweet.",intermittentfasting,1633014165

I get plenty of sleep. I drink plain green tea in the morning (because I hate straight black coffee and I don‚Äôt want to ruin anything with that fast by adding milk to it).

The highest weight I ever got to was around 179 lbs. My weight skyrocketed in early 2020 because of hormonal issues (and I‚Äôm sure other stress factors affected it). I got that resolved, and dropped to about 170lbs. thru 2020. Since then I have been yo-yoing with my weight; the lowest I‚Äôve been was 159 lbs. only a couple of months ago (maybe 2), but as you can see my weight has just gone right back up without me changing anything. 

My previous weight loss strategies included cutting out alcohol, counting calories and maintaining a caloric deficit, I‚Äôve gone gluten free, vegetarian, and all while doing HIIT 4x a week and doing walks/runs. I cook all of my meals at home. 

So I‚Äôm really hoping that intermittent fasting will help me return to the weight I have felt the best at in my life and burn off body fat, because so far nothing else is working.

I'm thinking if I can switch to an energy drink without calories during the morning I could do the work fast, I just worry about over eating when I get home and having enough energy after work to go to the gym. I might be able to swing an Omad Type diet in the evenings?

4468,Went on a terrible binge for almost a month but still kept up my 18:6 IF,"I struggle really hard with binge eating. Before I started IF, I would eat an entire family size bag of chips or similar junk, then eat dinner, followed by dessert or a multitude of other junk. The binging would usually start after work, around 6pm, and last until 9pm. For this reason, when I started IF, I made my eating window from 1pm-7pm, so I wouldn‚Äôt spend so much time binging after work. 

Well. I fell off the no-binge bandwagon. I had done great for several months (and had lost almost 30lbs). but this past month I reverted to buying a few family size bags of chips per week and binged them a few days a week. 

I feel a lot of shame right now. But the silver lining is, I didn‚Äôt give up my IF. And because I have a hard cutoff at 7PM, the binging was ONLY the chips and not a multitude of other things. 

In the past month I hadn‚Äôt weighed myself at all. I was afraid to do so, because of all of the weight I likely gained. But thankfully, because the IF restricted a lot of what I would have eaten, I didn‚Äôt gain any weight. 


I‚Äôm not naive enough to say that I can binge every day from now on and be good as long as I‚Äôm doing IF. I know that‚Äôs not the case. But if it wasn‚Äôt for IF, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to correct my actions this quickly. I would have spiraled and gained back every pound I had lost.

I'm on IF since early June 2021. So far I lost about 20 pounds, going from 285 lbs to 265 lbs. I'm pretty happy with that but that's not all. I completely stabilized my blood pressure, going from 140/90 with medications (i was not able to go below 140/90 for YEARS).

But the biggest surprise was for my diabetes (type 2 by the way).  I was taking 5 pills in the morning and 4 at dinner (metformin, glyburide and januvia). I now only take 2 pills in the morning (metformin) and 3 pills at dinner (metformin and glyburide). I continue to follow very closely my blood suger to make sure I don't fall in hypoglycemia and hope to drop the dinner glyburide soon. My estimated A1C (with mySugr app) is 5.6%. I can't wait to see my real one when i see my doctor.

I'm seeing my doc next month and I think she'll be amazed by this complete stabilization.

By the way, i'm on nearly OMAD with a minimum fasting of 21 hours per day. I'm taking two 20 minutes walk per day as well (which probably help a bit too).

My doctor suggested I read The Obesity Code and check out IF. In the last month of 20:4, I have lost seven pounds, and it is SO EASY. I don't even think about it.

I've been doing IF combined with daily exercise for 3 months and consistently have lost 0.5kg a week. I'm even half way to my GW which is awesome! But today was my weekly weight in day and as suspected, no change from last Monday. 
I know why. The first date night after 4 months of Covid lockdown in my city resulted in too much food and wine and last week some unnecessary chocolate crept into my life at the end of my weekday OMAD meals. 
I've done so well to get to this point, so why is one indulgent week ruining my mindset? Negative self talk is already starting again, despite months of success and positivity. Why are our brains SO good at doing this to ourselves?

- I am starting couch to 5K tomorrow
- I am on a deadlift strength program that has me doing 1 day per week of heavy lifting.

4514,"When people say fasting is starving myself, I give them this answer.","From ""The Complete Guide to Fasting,"" by Dr. Jason Fung:

""Fasting is completely different from starvation in one crucial way: control. Starvation is the involuntary abstention from eating. It is neither deliberate nor controlled. Starving people have no idea when or where their next meal will come from. This happens in times of war and famine, when food is scarce. Fasting, on the other hand, is the voluntary abstention from eating for spiritual, health, or other reasons. Food is readily available, but you choose not to eat it. No matter what your reason for abstaining, the fact that fasting is voluntary is a critical distinction.""",intermittentfasting,1635727386

My problem is that my sleep schedule is not regular due to my job and I don't know how to balance that with eating. 

Is it better to align your eating schedule with your sleep schedule - i.e. eating a certain number of hours after you wake up and a certainly number of hours before you go to sleep - or is it better to be consistent with the time of day - i.e. the way I have it now with the AM and PM?

4534,"IF since August 2020, 130 lb down, first 16/8 and OMAD since 12/20","First off, sorry for the dirty mirror. Didn't plan on sharing those pics with anyone.  

**SW 340lb, CW 210lb, GW 170lb, 40F, 6'2** 

The pics  in scrubs show the size I used to wear and the size I'm wearing now.

I'm sharing this mainly to encourage everybody on their weight loss journey to keep going and to not give up on themselves! I've been through so much yoyo-dieting in my life and only now at 40 have I finally reached a number on the scale that I haven't seen since I was a teenager. My BMI is 27,3 and a healthy weight range is finally in sight. I work in the medical field and no matter what your dreams of being slim and sexy and whatever are after weightloss, let me tell you that not getting diabetes, cancer or a coronary disease are already worth it and you can reap those benefits at any age!

My personal experience with IF is that I hugely benefitted from OMAD because with frequent meals come frequent insulin spikes that left me constantly feeling hungry and dissatisfied with small portions. I also learnt that my body is not an idiot and chewing gum with sweetener, drinking coffee with a splash of milk or drinking diet soda didn't kick me out of ketosis in a noticeable way. However, I believe that this is an experience that may vary in individuals.

I'm not really certain about my GW because the BMI scale is not completely reliable for tall people. I want to get in a healthy BMI range. But my initial GW of 77kg may not work out. I'll see about that in the future...

On the other hand, when I don't schedule a training session the next day, I usually have a normal dinner (before 8 PM anyway).

Keep in mind I have a very fast metabolism, so I fast to have more energy in the morning, not for weight loss. And with training I mean mainly weights; when I do cardio (during the summer), I'll have dinner and skip breakfast, since cardio wrecks havoc on my short term digestion.

4577,I'm plateauing and I shouldn't be! Help!,"Good morning, sweet summer children.

I am a 31F. 140lbs. 5'2"" down from 255lbs for a total loss of about 115lbs. I take on average 15k steps per day. 

I lost the bulk of my weight through diet and exercise. Calorie deficits achieved through clean eating and LISS with some bursts of HIIT peppered in. Mostly just hitting step goals and hiking and doing what I can to be active when I can.

I did a bout of reverse dieting to hit maintenance with success in March of this year. In May I dropped from 2300 calories to 1800 calories per day and saw no movement. I've been kind of casually just trying to find what works for me now in terms of maintaining, so I haven't lost any additional weight in roughly 5 months. 

I stick around 1600 calories now and I am seeing no movement despite my fitness tracker clocking an output of 2300-2500 per day.

The problem I'm facing now is that I am having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of dropping into another calorie deficit without screwing up my metabolism, which I managed to avoid by some miracle the first time (I was in a 1000 cal deficit per day for roughly a year). I believe i hovered roughly around 1200-1300 calories per day when I was doing most of my work last year. 

So, help me understand. I've started a 16:8 IF in the hopes of dropping those last 10lbs but I'm seeing little movement compared to how I would drop weight last year. I've been fasting for a few weeks but in deficit for much longer than that. When I had my body fat measured in may I was around 26%. My Fitbit scale says 28% but I know it's likely not accurate. 

Is it safe for me to drop lower again in combination with my fast? I am a single parent and very very busy, and on opposite work schedules with my partner so right now additional activity is a challenge, although I do VR fitness games often and I own a treadmill and a stationary bike. 

I might just be too far I my head about this and my ADHD brain is just overwhelmed.

The packets are like 20 calories and I've lived by the 'not one single calorie during fasting' so I'm super paranoid to try. I would hate to have a setback by trying it but he's been doing it for 8 months with major loss gains.

Has anyone tried this? Any help is appreciated.",intermittentfasting,1635528917

4621,Trouble Sleeping After 48-Hour Fast,"Hello, 

I recently finished a 48-hour fast. It all went well and I felt really good at the end. I honestly felt like I could have pushed it out another day. However, I am very active in the gym and with trail running. I want to make sure I am getting protein and fat to fuel my body so I track and weigh out everything I am eating. 

Last night, I broke my fast with some bone broth, salmon and broccoli. I did not over eat and I felt fine after eating. I did not feel jittery or anything like that, but I could not fall asleep! I was up until 7:30 AM this morning trying to get to sleep. I finally fell asleep at about 8 AM and woke up at 10 AM because I had to get into the office. I make a point not to drink any coffee after 9 am and yesterday was no different. So, the only thing I can think of that might be causing this was the breaking of this extended fast. I usually do 23:1 OMAD and I generally do not have much trouble falling asleep at night. So I am curious if breaking this 48-fast was the culprit. 

Does anyone else have issues like this after breaking a long fast? Curious to hear some thoughts. 

Thanks!",intermittentfasting,1635525239
4622,Looking forward to learning from you guys,"Hi - new here.   Early 50s male, 5-9 and 178lbs.

I run lots and am interested interested in dropping down to low 160s.

I‚Äôm happy with my build except for my midsection.   Recently a running buddy told me that he didn‚Äôt want to offend me but if I trimmed some weight I‚Äôd be way faster and might even podium at some races.  I don‚Äôt run for podiums, but I also don‚Äôt want to waste any unrealized potential b/c I‚Äôm a butterball!

I ran a 3:19 marathon in 2019 and ran a 3:38 a few weeks ago (I cramped up at mile 23 and was literally on the side of the road and barely limped in the last 3 miles).

Does anyone here have experience fasting while running lots of miles?   I‚Äôm really intrigued by Intermittent Fasting and how it might help me lighten my load and help me be more healthy.

FULL. DISCLOSURE:  I drink too many IPAs and I‚Äôm trying to get that under control.

Thanks for any resources and tips you can share.

I can post a pic if that will help show what my build is like if that will impact how I should fast.  I‚Äôm happy with everything except my midsection.",intermittentfasting,1635523081
4623,App recommendations?,"Hi all,

Longtime lurker here. I'm 36M, CW 230 lbs, first goal weight is 200. I started IF about 16 months ago (SW 256), but ran out of steam about 4 months in and in the last year have only lost \~10 lbs. I usually try to do 16:8 most days with an OMAD thrown in here and there, but my biggest struggle is evening snacking or eating too much for supper.

I'm primarily posting because I'm wondering what apps folks use for tracking IF, weight loss, and longer fasts (thinking to start a longer fast but I often cave halfway through and wondering if an app would help me stick to it). I've also been using a spreadsheet to track my weight loss against my goal, but I'm way past my original target date now so it's not super useful anymore.

I swallowed the juice from the bite but none of the flesh, do you think this would be sugary enough in such a small quantity to produce an effect?

Should I just eat now or am I still good from an autophagy perspective? I suspect I may be fine from a fat burning fast perspective but not totally sure on that either! Any help would be greatly appreciated.

4641,Having fun and doing some kind of study when people react to my 37 kg (81 lbs) lost in 9 months.,"When I meet people who I haven't seen in the past year, 99% of the time I get the ""what did you do?‚Äù almost no one have asked ""are you sick?"" Which by that I presume I really don't look sick (THANKS IF for that!). First I go for the ""low carb"", and they mostly go ""yeah good for you, cutout pizza, beer and pasta and you're set!""  they mostly act like if it was that simple. Right away comes the ""going to the gym?"" And then I tell them, ""I don't even walk past my car in the garage"" THEN they start to pay attention, there's very few things as appealing to a obese person than to lose weight with no exercise.

Then is when I start my little research on people's opinions and dogmas of a ""healthy diet"" I go for the HIGH FAT, most will smile, when I tell them about the amount of bacon, pork, beef, butter, etc that I eat, they see me like if I have found the holy grail, some will say that they heard something about it, and act like if that was the solution. 

But then I take a sharp turn and tell them about only eating once a day. THEN they take a step back like if it was something contagious and bad. Most will say that is not possible, and that is very unhealthy, they, still are trying to imagine a day without having any food until 7 pm, it is just not possible, that the heartache and acid reflux they would get would be unbearable and some will try to convert me back because it is just not natural. Very few times I have told them about the 36, 48, 72 hours fasts, BIG MISTAKE. Whatever I tell them after they just won't believe me anymore, I completely lose their attention, so I stopped talking about those fasts.

Most people will just try to end the conversation a bit awkwardly and try to forget the whole thing and just say ""congratulations, you look great""

Now comes the part that I care the most, when people are in the shape I was, I feel different, odd about how to approach them, because I feel the need to get their attention to see if I can plant the seed of interest in them. I don't go out preaching this way of life, but now I KNOW the difference it can make,  I just want them to be really interested and ASK for some help, guidance, whatever, to come out of their mouths, minds and intention, I won't tell them what to do, but I will tell them where to read, what youtube videos got me hooked, what podcasts to listen and of course what  subreddits join for more information. 

Do you have any suggestions on what to do when talking to people who you know need to have this information ASAP in a way that they will actually take interest? or just let them go their way and someday like me , by chance watch a video on YouTube and start investigating? I wish I had known this 10 years I ago, I wish someone would have talked to me in a way that if would have been appealing to research. I am grateful now but I do wish it was sooner.

Some have actually listen with a bit of more open mind because they are seeing me and they don't believe their eyes, that I went from a 42 pants size, XXL shirt to  a 32 pants and L shirt in less than a year, it is just something not seen before so they pay some attention, but I mostly lose them during the ""fasting talk"".

Has this happened to you? Have you got more people interested? BTW ONE has actually asked and started this journey, he is slowing getting the hang of it.

Thanks and sorry for the long post.

4648,Modified ADF Experiences?,"Alrighty y‚Äôall. Short story: I am pretty familiar with IF, have done the whole range, 16:8-60hr fasts. I went a whole month last year doing ADF. I lost about 20+lbs for the entire duration I did IF (March ‚Äò20-August‚Äô20). Sucks but got depressed, stopped, and probably gained like 50 lbs putting me at my highest weight ever. 

I‚Äôve been fasting for the last month doing anywhere from 16:8-20/21 hrs and have switched back to on/off OMAD for the last few weeks. I haven‚Äôt weighed myself because one of my mistakes last year was becoming too obsessed with those numbers which I think didn‚Äôt help my mental state. Thankfully I‚Äôm doing much better mentally, but the weight didn‚Äôt improve like my mental health did. 

I was thinking about doing a modified ADF with a 500 cal meal on fasting days. The reason I am thinking this is because I was absolutely miserable on my clean fasting days. Just wanted to see if anyone else had good experiences with modified ADF. I‚Äôm chilling rn with OMAD so I‚Äôm interested in trying to step it it up.

4659,I want to try IF but I'm scared to.,"I was always the skinny girl. At 18, I was 5'7"" and weighed 110lbs. I didn't even have to try. In fact, I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Cheesecake, pie, ice cream, endless junk and almost no healthy foods. I'd eat my huge serving of a meal, then whatever anyone else didn't want to finish from their plates, and then go back for more. Everyone talked endlessly about how thin I was, how long my legs were, how tiny my waist was. That's the most common compliment I got for 18 years. ""You're so tall and thin. You could be a model. "" The literal only insecurity I had about my body growing up was my relative lack of breasts. 

Then I had a child. I went from 110 lbs to over 180 in a matter of 9 months. 

I only lost 20lbs immediately after having my child, and since that, it's been impossible. I tried diets like keto. I reached 195lbs. I tried doing Insanity. I reached 200lbs. I tried a calorie deficit, eating less than 1000 calories a day eventually. I reached 215lbs. No matter what, I gained weight. My doctor put me on Metformin for my PCOS related insulin resistance, and I stopped gaining as quickly but I've slowly creeped up another 5lbs over the last four years, clawing and dragging to try to stop it the whole way. I weigh 220lbs today. 

I want to try IF, but I'm afraid of the strict structure of it causing me to develop an eating disorder. Keto came pretty close, as did calorie counting. I am very hard on myself for how I look. My mom is over 400lbs and I get more comments every day about how much I look like her. I never looked like her until the weight gain. I looked like my father, like my brother who doesn't share a mother with me. So it's really the fat distribution they're commenting on, not my face structure. It's made me more and more toxic in my view of my body. 

People accidentally let slip micro-insults all the time. ""Why are you making me exercise? "" (I was talking about carrying fire wood around.) ""Well look at you.""  That one felt like a physical slap. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else had this sort of concern (possible eating disorders, body issues), and found a way to do the intermittent fasting in a healthy, balanced way that didn't take over everything and cause disordered eating. Any advice?

I am 21 years old, 6'1 male. I was overweight since I was 11 years old and in the mid of 2020, I deiced enough is enough and started doing fasting (16:8) and home workout (since covid and all) almost 7 days a week. So I started around 253 lbs and I hit my goal of 165 lbs around January this year. By that time I noticed a major change in my physic and big face gains. I was getting a lot of compliments about my new look (went from XXL to M). But I wasn't still happy with how I looked shirtless.

So since then, I have been doing bodyweight training with some dumbells and resistance bands (GYMs ain't still really safe from covid where I live). With that, I notice a positive change in my posture and some shoulder gains but still my chest area and doesn't look great. Side note here, I had gynecomastia surgery when I was 13 years old. So I still have scars from that too.

Anyway, that's my background and the question I wanted to ask is what can I do to improve my cheat area and how to get rid of these markings just below the chest area. I tried to google about this but I couldn't find any term to call these other than stretch marks and I am not sure if it's the correct word.

I (M48) do body weight strength exercises 3-4 times per week, walk 3 miles daily, and play occasional golf for exercise.

Body fat %: -1.1%

Lean body mass: -4.5 lbs

Protein: +0.2%

4782,Say Goodbye To Sugar Cravings With Intermittent Fasting,"Chocolate, cookies, ice cream ‚Äì a sweet tooth‚Äôs lover's dream! Indulging in an occasional treat is good for your emotional well-being. But when you consume sugar regularly, your body is never satisfied.

Of the more than 600,000 food products found on the typical grocery‚Äôs shelf, 80 percent contain added sugar. The average person consumes one pound of sugar a day 

Sugar cravings can be difficult to overcome but intermittent fasting can help. When one begins fasting for the day, the hunger-suppressing hormone leptin levels initially increase, appetite decreases and sweet tooth desires lessen. 

When one stays in a fasted state for a long period, leptin levels start to drop. This may cause feelings of increased hunger and desires for sugar the first couple of weeks. As leptin levels normalize, hunger and sugar cravings subside and in time the sugar craving cycle can be broken.

4792,"Passing 260 for the third time, and why I think IF will be different","So I have only been on IF for a little over two months now - it's that last dip from 280 lbs on the chart. I've enjoyed how supportive this sub is. And I wanted to post some insights and encouragement from my own experience for others out there who similarly bounce back and forth and why I think IF is different. For me, it all comes down willpower vs structure.

I've always been a bit heavy throughout life, but fairly active jobs and the wonders of a teenage and young adult metabolism kept me from getting too unhealthy. Several years back I was going through some life stuff and one of the areas I turned for comfort was food. Having the scale finally push over 300 was a bit of a wake up call though, in addition to all the day to day signs - getting winded on stairs, not being able to enjoy physical activities as much, etc.

I poked about at watching what I ate or being more active, but It wasn't until July 2016 at 312 lbs that I really got serious about making a change though. I finally started counting calories and walking, **a lot**. And I had success, by that fall I had dropped down to around 260. And... what I was doing was completely unsustainable and enabling bad habits.

See I was eating biscuit sandwiches for breakfast, steamed veggies and chicken for lunch - or some other super low cal meal, and most of a frozen pizza for dinner. I would just walk 2+ hours a day and much more on the weekends. Or just have 500 calorie days on Sat and/or Sun to make weekly calorie goals. I just used CICO as a cudgel without any structure and forming healthy habits, and it was no surprise I quickly put that weight back on once life got more complicated and I couldn't walk almost \~20 hours a week.

It's not reflected on that graph, but a couple years later my life style had gotten a little more active, there was even with a few failed attempts at getting to the gym regularly and buying home workout equipment. Once again in July 2020 I was hovering around 280 lbs and decided to try out NOOM. If you're not familiar with NOOM, their program is a lot about the psychology of why/what you eat along with a heavy emphasis on calorie density - ie grapes vs raisins. After a few months I was seeing solid success bottoming out around 260 again.

And once again, eventually that willpower to track calories every day, not buy snacks, and check in on their little articles just dried up. So I slid back up to around 280 again.

Finally we come to a few months ago. A friend of mine has been doing OMAD for a while now, but I'd never really considered it. I happened across some IF information and I decided to try 16:8 for a month, skipping breakfast didn't seem that hard. Come to find out that IF works really well for me, I greatly enjoy the structure - it just clicks for some reason. Going back to the stop of willpower vs structure, for me willpower is a finite resource eventually it runs out and that's fine, but having the structure to fall back on alleviates needing to rely on just that. 

I've also enjoyed the flexibility. I tried OMAD for one week, and now sort of split the difference with a light lunch around 18:6. Sometimes I have breakfast and can adjust fasting window accordingly, maybe eat an early dinner. I've been able to enjoy eating out or celebrating my little sister's wedding, without needing to stress about it. I just adjust the next few days accordingly. Hell, I even find working out consistently to be easier now without it trying to consume hours of my day to hit calorie goals. One of my long term goals is to finally be able to do pull ups, never could in my life.

I may eventually need to get more diligent in my tracking to reach my goals, but for better or worse I did learn some things from my previous attempts on better portions and cleaner foods. Right now it's coming off pretty easy with only minor plateau, so I am just enjoying the process, the lifestyle change, and the marathon - not sprint - to a healthier me.

It's a bit unfair to call it ""2 months in"" since I have done IF for almost 3 years already but I didn't do it as seriously as I'm doing it now, also managing to exercise regularly (up to 10km/day) and doing 10 to 14 meals of the 14 weekly meals keto.

More than IF and Keto, the thing that works the best for me is running at least 2 or 3km of those +10km I do daily, it burns a lot more and I can lose a pound before and after exercise which helps set my weight for the rest of the day and allows me to lose weight almost every single day for the last 2 months.

4812,Realization of my shocking amount of boredom snacking,"Full disclosure, I'm just one week into my IF journey here.

For the last few years I've known, but have done nothing to address the fact that I'm a mega boredom eater.

I wouldn't be surprised if at least 1/2 my daily calories were from midday and post-dinner snacking. Working on the road has meant a lot of really poor gas station snacks. Countless nights in hotels equaled a ton of vending machine meals well after dinner was over.

I've decided on a 18:6 regimen eating between 12:30pm and 6:30pm

Closing the gap between meals (I do a small lunch and a ""normal"" dinner) has also reduced my midday munchies to a few cheese and crackers at the most.

But the evenings are where I've become so, so aware of my worst habit. No more Lunchables after an entire dinner. No ice cream. No breaking out the popcorn maker. No more beer and wine (though I still will indulge occasionally if it's pre-6:30pm cutoff).

More changes to make for sure. But I figured cutting out everything at once was not the right way for me. I've lost a good deal of weight in high school (I'm 36 now) so I do know I'm capable and roughly where I'd like to be weight-wise. 

This is such a manageable lifestyle for someone like myself who travels extensively for work. I've tried other ways in the past, which definitely had some success. But trying to manage with very specific foods in very small towns without the ability to bring your meals or cook away from home was frustratingly difficult.

I'm already sleeping better not stuffing an extra snack or two in my face thirty minutes before bed. Tonight I even tried baking some brownies to keep in the freezer and managed to not even try and lick the bowl. If you knew the old me, I'd have left a 1/2 cup of batter in there to eat while they cooked.",intermittentfasting,1630386134

2. If I am engaging in something that burns a lot of calories, such as swimming, how does everyone handle something like this on IF? Eat a bit before swimming to have calories and eat some protein after? or just stick on the schedule and plan swimming before the eating window opens, then eat a bit more protein/calories after the workout?

I ate whatever I wanted and hoped one day I would gain the motivation to lose the weight. Fast forward to a year ago, I started a new relationship, moved, changed jobs... Lost 30 pounds due to anxiety. It was a horrible time of my life, but I had gotten to a point where my body actually resembled how I wanted to look. I knew it wouldn't last forever thankfully, but I didn't want to go back to where I was. So I took up 16:8 intermittent fasting.

I really don't want to gain weight again, but I have the craving to satisfy the hunger and it is seemingly impossible to curb the hunger. I am able to do the fasting periods most days, I only break it when my work schedule is unfavorable which unfortunately is once or twice a week. Help me please :( I am desperate for advice.

Me: 
30F, 5'10"", SW 205, CW 198, GW 155. 
16/8 or OMAD + weight lifting and light cardio.

I've been doing IF consistently for about 2 months now. I started IF for weight loss, mental clarity, and improved mood (which so many people claim to experience). While I'm losing weight and feeling healthier, I'm also noticing new mental health problems, and am wondering what I should change, or if I should quit?

I've had mental health issues for most of my life. I've known for a long time that what I eat affects my mood. Sugar, dairy, alcohol, and caffeine all have a negative effect. I've been doing 16/8 and occasional OMAD. I've tried different fasting windows, and I get enough calories and track macros and nutrients. Focused on whole foods, high protein, moderate carbs, plenty of veg, fruit, water, plus a multivitamin. My body feels and looks better. Yet, I've noticed new apathy, suicidal ideation, and a general ""dead inside"" feeling. I'm not worried about acting on those thoughts, and have alerted my partner and doctor, but I am miserable: all day, every day, I'm going back and forth between crying for no reason, or else feeling numb and hopeless.

Will this even out? Will it end? I like IF otherwise. This is also weird because I've done several long-term fasts over the years (1-4 days at a time) without any mental health issues besides a blah feeling for the first half-day.

* the biggest thing I‚Äôve learned is if you fall off the wagon one night from booze and Taco Bell or whatever, just hop right back on immediately. DONT WAIT ‚ÄúTILL MONDAY‚Äù!
* while 16:8 has been right for me, it wasn‚Äôt gospel. Sometimes I went a few hours longer and occasionally I went a little less. But I didn‚Äôt let it dictate my life.
* more important than IF was protein, calories, and movement. I tried to keep protein around .8 X my body weight as much as I could. I stayed in a caloric deficit while hitting protein and tried to make sure I was walking, doing elliptical, rowing or something every day.


I don‚Äôt have a pic of when I was at 260 (at least a progress pic style one), but I do have one from 230, and when I hit my next goal I‚Äôll find that one and take a current one to show progress.


Anyways. I‚Äôm happy. This milestone feels really good, but feels just like the start. Next number in my head is to see body fat between 12-15%, but really more to just look at my progress and feel like I‚Äôm at a place that makes me comfortable.


Thanks to all the progress pics and motivators along the way. It‚Äôs weird but seeing your wins has truly motivated me.",intermittentfasting,1630333075

4859,Accountability. Telling on myself.,"So I've been doing really well with my relationship with food because of IF. I'd lost 30 lbs in under 4 months, was feeling a lot happier, and focused. I was starting to like the way I looked again. Exercising everyday etc. last week I started slipping into old habits and yesterday was a total blow out.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with drinking a milkshake within my window. Then it was eating out during my window and getting a huge burger and fries. Then expanding my window from 20:4 to 18:6 to 16:8 convincing myself it was ok, it's still IF after all. I've used food for emotional soothing for a long time and some stressors came up, instead of just doing something else healthy I went to the old habit. So it was back to binging and then punishing myself with 10 mile runs for eating garbage food. 

Yesterday I stayed in bed all day and boy 'o boy did I binge. All. Day. Long. I don't want to list the foods I ordered and made because it's honestly depraved. I feel like shit this morning. My kitchen is a wreck. My stomach is rumbling. I slept like total garbage. 

So one week isn't really going to derail me from my goals. The scale doesn't even show me gaining weight. I am just here to tell on myself because it isn't healthy emotionally in the long run. Let alone physically. I am going back to taking control of myself. Even though stuffing myself gives me a short term happy feeling long term it only makes it worse. 

Here's to a good day of living in the present and living purposefully. If you have one foot in the past and one foot in the future you're pissing on today and I'm not doing it. I'm going back to 20:4 and exercising a moderate amount, not punishing myself, and eating healthy foods that feed my body not the monkey on my back.",intermittentfasting,1630326374

4878,NEWBIE POST: Advice requested please," 

Howdy All!

I'm posting this here since it seems like no one is checking the Newbie megathread...hoping I can get a reply please.

I'm in my mid 40s, male, about 6 feet tall and weigh about 300 (hard for me to believe that).

My goal weight is 230 or below (min is 230).

I've tried various diets and have had no lasting success as I stress eat a lot.

My  current plan is to start IF slowly, limiting eating from 9 30 am to 630  pm, then pull off an hour every 2 weeks till I can get to a 6/18. I'll  be walking and swimming and biking for exercise, about 3-4 times per  week, which I have been doing (though diet is the main issue right now).

I have some questions and would love to hear some thoughts please especially from those who have had success:

1. My  biggest issue is stress eating, which I am working on. I also don't  like feeling deprived. When starting out, I don't want to trick myself  into thinking I can eat whatever I want in whatever quantity I want. I  know from the documentation from this sub that I should remove all  refined carbs, but during the period when we can eat, are most  successful IF followers sticking to a diet at that point as well? Or  eating generally clean?
2. To  confirm, this is a method that can be used to get down to the desired  weight, but isn't necessarily something meant for long term? Is that  correct?
3. If  I can get down to my goal weight, then do I reintroduce certain times  or foods at that point? And have periodic IFs for maintenance?
4. For those that have lost a lot of weight quick --- what are some of the recommendations and tips for how you got through?
5. For  those that have lost a lot of weight quick -- what about excess skin? I  hate going under for operations, but has anyone done skin removal?

I  appreciate any and all help. Trying to lose weight due to various  health issues (some minor and some quite serious) plus want to be around  for family and my kid.

Hoping this is the ticket to getting me back to where I was....

Thanks and take care!",intermittentfasting,1630289113
4881,Does extending my window by 30 minutes certain days throw off the benefits of IF?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a 5'4 130 lb 24 year old male and have a dumb question as it relates to my fasting window. 

To elaborate a bit, my typical fasting window is usually from 11:30 PM - 4 PM because I work late nights, and unfortunately my schedule has changed slightly where I am now working 30 minutes longer than I normally do on M/W/F.

If I happen to have my last meal around midnight on M/W/F and then revert back to my typical window on T/Th/Sat/Sun where I am done eating by 11:30, will I still be reaping the full benefits of IF, or is it vital that one sticks to a very strict fasting schedule where half an hour would be too much of a deviation?

I am currently a medical student, and I‚Äôve been trying to do intermittent fasting, but haven‚Äôt had much long-term success. 

The weeks where I stick to my routine (16:8) are the best for me, and I usually do well when we start a new ‚Äúblock‚Äù after a big exam. As we get closer to each new exam though, priorities get shifted in order to prepare and things slip to the side. I don‚Äôt necessarily gain any weight past my original point, but it seems as if my life revolves around the numbers on the scale. I have a partner who is really encouraging, and they have no issues with how I look, but I still hate the way I look most days.

In all reality, health-wise I am fine. I did a fat-caliper measurement a few weeks ago at school and I am around ~14-15% body fat, and I figured I would be way more. Everyone could probably manage to lose a few pounds, and that‚Äôs my main reason to do IF, but a big portion of my emotional/mental health revolves around that scale. Currently 215, Goal of 200.

4901,First month expectations?,"Hey all,

I'm having a hard time justifying intermittent fasting as what will work for me long term. Granted, it's only been a month and I've been planning to stick with this until at least December. But I'm not seeing very much change at all. 
I am female, 33, 5 ft 4 in, I'm starting weight was 210 lb. I'm currently at 207 lbs. So there has been some progress but prrreeeetty slow. I'm doing this in solidarity with BF (we both need to loose the weight and he got excited about IF) I've been on my weight loss journey for 8 years, with a roller coaster of success and failures. But everything else I've done so far has had more dramatic results after the first month. And my lucky guy has already dropped down 15 lb in this last month with IF. He's rocking it and I'm so proud! 
This is why I wanted to ask and see if maybe my expectations are too high for myself? And what you all experienced after your first month? Is a 3 lb loss after doing 16:8 for month normal? 

Little extra info: I do know that guys lose weight different than girls, but that's a pretty dramatic difference between the two of us. He's counting calories more strictly than I am.

Just got back into IF a few days ago, this time I'm doing 18:6, between 12PM and 6PM. Everything's going well so far, I'm resisting each and every unhealthy craving and getting better at it with each day that passes. I also smoke, so that helps with hunger a little, I guess.

What do you think about my only 2 meals in the day?

Breakfast (12PM-1PM): 50g oats / 50g wild forest fruits / 200g low fat yogurt / 20g organic honey, made by my dad. It sits at around 400 calories.

Dinner (5PM-6PM): 200g of chicken breast / 200g vegetable mix (green peas, corn, red pepper, rice). Has a maximum of 400 calories, I think.

I started with OMAD 5x/week, continued that until two weeks in when I got moderate symptoms of electrolyte imbalance.

I then retracked a bit and continued fasting on 18/6 five-six times a week. I also started drinking sodium-potassium-magnesium -filled water (about 2g of sodium/potassium per 1,5l of water, one bottle per day).

Well, here we are four weeks in. My symptoms mostly disappeared but I still suffer from mild fatigue (I feel exhausted most of the time) and I get some weird heart palpitations/being ""aware"" of my heart so to say.

I want to fast but it seems the early OMAD start made me flush all my electrolytes out of my system and now the new balance is being reconfigured or something?

Not sure where to go from here. I don't want my weight loss journey to feel like I am doing harm to my body. Is this feeling going to stop one day? Should I increase my electrolyte amounts? I'm 192cm / 127 kg. Daily calories come to about 1500-1700.

4960,Unable to lose weight for about a 1-2 months now. Need advise?,"Hello,

So in Dec, 2019 I started to lose weight using a combination of fasting and walking I would sometimes fast for 2 or 3 days at a time. I am 6 foot 3 inch, and I weighed 365 pounds. As of today I currently weigh 258 pounds, with my lowest being 255. So close to 110 pounds lost. However, for the last month or two I can't seem to lose no matter what I try, I'm stuck between 260 and 255. My goal is to get between 210 - 220.  More recently I've been doing keto combined with OMAD (dinner being my time of eating). I'm active, but not as much as I probably should be... I usually lift weights at-least 2 or 3 times a week and occasional walks on the treadmill w/ high incline usually 4 miles. I do plan to increase the weight lifting specifically as I am interested in building muscle now. I found that fasting for more then one day, I start to feel miserable and tend to want to overeat when I do eat. 

I'm not sure what do at this point. When I eat my OMAD I eat foods high in protein and low in carbs. I eat cheese, peanut butter, meat, tuna fish, vegetables. During the day I only drink water until dinner. If I eat a burgers or something like that it's always 80% lean / 20% fat, no buns or anything like that. I've basically cut out bread, and anything high in carbs. When I was tracking this I was lucky to eat 1200 -1400 calories a day, and I was always under 25g of carbs. But even still I can weigh myself before eating my OMAD, and then weigh myself again the next night and it seems like it took my body all night and day just to burn the few pounds I put on eating the night before, sometimes even gaining some weight slightly.

At this point, I'm about to go back to the 2 or 3 day fasting, because at-least that was working... any help or advice?",intermittentfasting,1630184741

4963,Been doing CICO for almost 6 months and have lost motivation thinking IF might jumpstart me again?,"So I lost motivation to do CICO after 5 months of steady weight loss.

I sprained my ankle and then moved and then went on vacation so I totally fell off the wagon for a whole month. Somehow I didn't gain any weight, but I can't get myself back on track. I'm still counting calories but not nearly to the accuracy that I was before and I figure that I'm generally hitting maintenance or right under maintenance most days. 

I hope that getting more rigid about IF will help me get my calorie consumption under control again so I can lose these last 10lb. Going to get a gym membership and start weight training too I think. Posting I guess for accountability and to see if anyone else had a similar falling off the wagon close to the 6 month mark.

Even though I basically didn't do any IF or CICO for the week I still tracked everything. That proves to myself that this was a temporary setback and that I'm still in this. One bad week of not sticking with it after months of progress will not stop me from my goal!
 I really went crazy and ate everything sugary I had in the house and then I went to the store just to buy cream cheese for frosting some chocolate zucchini muffins. According to MFP, despite the zucchini and coconut sugar  they are still not ""healthy."" At all. And yet I ate 3 of them in one day. That's the week I've had. Shameful, but it was my first time making them and they were so good I don't even care.

And despite this failure of a week I'm still proud of what I've accomplished. I have stuck with it this whole time until this and have lost 30lbs since May. (30F SW:173 CW:142 GW:129) I'm in the healthy category of BMI now. I have completely changed my relationship with food in sustainable ways, I've been exercising more, and I'm healthier in general. I can't even be mad at myself for this lapse. It happens sometimes, right? It took me 30 years to gain all that weight and I weighed 260lbs at my heaviest. I'm doing great. I can have a zucchini cupcake (or 3) and still keep working toward my goals. I've been on this sub telling other people the same thing for months, right?

Then 2020 and 2021 happened and I gained a lot of weight back and I pretty much stopped fasting altogether.  

The past week I tried to jump straight back into fasting, doing 20+ hour fasts and this past Monday I did a 48 hour fast. It went well so I tried to complete another one yesterday. I went on a walk last night, came back and my heart was feeling really weird. I ate a popsicle, some crackers, and drank Gatorade to get my electrolytes back up. Went to bed. Everything seemed okay. 

Didn‚Äôt have anything today except for a sugary Starbucks drink this morning (350 cals). Just now I had my dinner and while eating the funny heart feeling came back. I would describe it almost like the feeling you get in your heart while dropping on a rollercoaster, except way less extreme. It happens every few minutes with just a general feeling of uneasiness in between. It feels a bit like it‚Äôs jumping here and there.

Never had any problems but slept better, immune system MUCH stronger, slowly lost fat and gained muscle. I lost about two clothing sizes.

But I am in chronic burnout and had terrible panic attacks at the end of November. I even experienced situational mutism which was terrifying. The psychiatrist who prescribes my ADHD medication (Elvanse, or Vyvanse in the US) put me on Venlafaxine, an SRNI, at the lowest dosage.

I'm autistic and I react quite strongly to all kinds of substances. This drug made me ""flat"" as in no panic attacks, but my sense of humor was also gone. And I slept terribly, with extremely realistic nightmares.The doctor decided I should double the dose on January 6th.

So I'm 5'4 and 260 pounds and mid-30s. Was always healthy..now hormones are slowly getting out of whack and I have moderate sleep apnea and snore when I never have in my life. pre-diabetic A1C 5.8 -- and sleeping/insomnia issues that I wonder if they were tied into all of this .. I'm a little disappointed I let myself get this far and have gone through all the steps to get a gastric sleeve and I'm VERY close to being able to get a surgery date but I'm sort of getting cold feet about it.   


I started doing 18:6 fasting... and while I'm definitely hungry the last 2 hours leading up to mealtime.. I have stuck to it.. for a week.. no biggie.. but still I'm impressed. I never thought I'd be able to fast because of my PCOS and just being so hungry all the time...then I had two doc appts back to back that required fasting for bloodwork and another for ultrasound..and they were late in the day appts so I looked and I didn't eat 20 hours for one and 22 hours for the other..   


What inspired me to try fasting was that I noticed after I passed the 18th hour, the hunger was weirdly not as ravenous.. both times.. I thought.. ok.. my body has got to be onto something.   


I've also ready VERY inspiring stories of people who got their A1C from diabetic to 4.9 in months.. and I know a few people who did it with IF. I just never thought I could do it.  


I'm super not crazy about the gastric sleeve leaving staples inside of me internally (i gotta be honest) ..please no hate.. it's just a weird thing I have.. I feel like foreign objects in the body do eventually make you sick.. and my experience with docs is that they never listen to you when you say you are.. so I hate to get these and then have issues and I do seem to be in that 1%... Also.. there are docs still saying breast implants are safe when we know millions of women sharing their experience with breast implant illness so hearing something is safe from the medical world just doesn't do it for me.   


Also, I'm looking at the timeline and it may be months before I get this surgery and I thought.. in all that time can't I just start fasting and end up in the same place weight loss wise over the course of a year anyway? (Perhaps IF being a little slower)... Gastric sleeve to me is just a forced fast...where your stomach is permanently removed to force you to fast.. per se..

What can I do about this stress eating?

It happened again over the last couple of days. I'll be doing a fast, it's going great, and then I get stressed out at work and I end up binging on a ton of junk food.

It is getting really really bad, and it is honestly ruining my diet. Every time I get stressed out at work or from life, I end up going to Walmart and buying like $20 worth of candy, chips, ice cream, and just lots of stuff that is horrible for you. Then I eat thousands of calories, and my deficit is ruined.

What can I do to stop this? I tried eating lower calorie foods, and that didn't help.

Is it as simple as accepting the fact that life is really really really hard, and if I want to have a good physique and succeed, I can't cope by stress eating? Maybe if I'm working on a stressful project, I could take 5 minute video game breaks to destress instead of eating everything in sight, ruining my chances of having a nice physique? All this stress eating is kind of ruining my fasting ""flow,"" and it is for sure putting me into a surplus.

I'm new to IF, I've chosen this method for weight loss for a variety of reasons and am doing 20:4 without any issues except for one fairly big one - indigestion.

I feel like with such a brief eating window, I shouldn't cut back on food, but I don't know what else to do.

Has anyone had any issues like this? Maybe this will subside after a while? I did try and google but most of the results I get are about reflux and heartburn and aren't helpful.

Everything was great! Then the holidays happened, and while I didn't gain, I didn't lose either. I got to late January and decided I needed to really get strict about my window and start being at least mindful of what I'm eating each day. It's been almost 2 weeks and I'm down 5 pounds! I've really found a good method for myself, and it mostly has to do with my thought approach.

&amp;#x200B;

My all-time highest weight was 206. I'm a woman, 5'6 and definitely curvy. Even at my lowest weight I had outrageous hips and DDs. My goal weight is 145. Current weight is 181. I set incremental goals so I get tiny victories often. It really helps with motivation. Current goal is 179.9. I am so close! I weighed around 175 just after giving birth, and that was only because I was breastfeeding and couldn't keep up with how much I was putting out (overproducer). I was around 185 before I got pregnant. So once I'm under 175, I will be the lowest weight I have been in at least 4 years. I think that's when I'll finally feel good about posting a full-body update photo.

Sorry for the rambling format of this post! I'm so overwhelmed by my progress. And also had 2 cups of coffee this morning and am still an hour away from breaking my fast. Excitement and caffeine jitters! Happy fasting, friends!",intermittentfasting,1643817960

I‚Äôve been doing IF (16:8, a few OMADs here and there) for about 7 weeks now while making a good faith attempt at CICO tracking with the goal of consuming 500 less calories than my maintenance, so currently about 1600 calories for my height/weight. In addition, I‚Äôve increased my physical activity so, at least according the best data I have available from my smart watch, I am fairly regularly coming in probably 300-500 *net* calories under my 1600 goal when taking into account calories burned.

I‚Äôm not in any hurry to lose weight for actual physical health concerns (though flirting with ‚Äúobese‚Äù instead of just ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù was a bummer), and my understanding is that up to 2 lbs lost per week is generally considered ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù but I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not in danger of causing my metabolism to slow down to compensate.

I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with dangerously high BS and an A1C of 11.1

First GP put me on Metformin 500 2x a day..In 2 weeks, I saw a very minor decline in BS but the meds were making me nauseous and were killing my appetite..

Went to a different GP who was enthusiastic about IF and cut my meds in half and advised that T2D is definitely reversible with IF and low carb diet..

So I just started IF 2 days ago and feel great..

In mere two days, daily BS are coming down to relatively acceptable ranges of 140 to 200..

My query is regarding ketosis..I know that it's different to DKA which I was apprised of when I was diagnosed, since my ketone level was quite high..

My question is, is there a chance of DKA when IF as well somehow? Because I'm scared of that..

I believe that when ketosis begins, I would get ketones in my blood sample/urine, but how do I know if it's from Ketosis or DKA?

So sorry in advance if it's a foolish or stupid question, but i'm trying to learn and be as vigilant about this stuff as possible..

Hi, I am a 57 year old male, 6', 1"". I'm about 289lbs, and I want to get to 180, and maintain that.

I started fasting about a month ago. I started with 16/8, and now I am fasting for 20 hours a day. 20 seems to be reasonably easy for me, so I am sticking with it for the moment. Right now, my meals are done from 6:00pm to 10:00pm. I go to sleep at 12:30am.

Last week was my first 24 hour fast. It went very well, with a few noticeable hunger pangs during the last hour. I am considering trying one 24 hour fast, and one 36 hour fast, once each month.

My main question: I am on some medications that I take for psoriatic arthritis (Methotrexate‚Äî2.5mg; Prednisone‚Äî5mg; Folic Acid‚Äî1mg; Oysco 500+D). I also take a multivitamin and a caffeine tablet once a day (the caffeine tablet has replaced soda for me).

Will taking the above outside my eating period be bad for the fast benefits? Which ingredients in the vitamins might affect the fast? I am pretty sure that sugar is one.

For example, the caffeine tablet has Tableting Sugar (Sucrose, Maltodextrin), Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate, Stearic Acid. Croscarmellose Sodium, Magnesium Stearate,  
Silicon Dioxide, Coating (Hypromellose, Glycerin).

After a pretty rough 2020 and 2021 in terms of dealing with hard interactions that humans simply shouldn't have to deal with my body had deteriorated to something shameful. I decided that I was gonna take matters back into my own hands as I had done before.   
I already knew a fair bit about how the body works from the whole psoriasis thing but now I'm applying it to a different kind of self-improvement, self-love, self-esteem direction.  
Id already been doing this a few weeks before the photo on the left. The photo on the right was today which was 6 days after the photo on the left.  


What I do is:   
One day - Total fasting (only water, tea, coffee), gentle morning run (2k), morning stretches, shower, take care of my skin with some oils, drink lots of water, go to work (15min each way by bicycle). Come home from work and do a decently hard home workout using an app (about 20min). Still dont eat. Go bed.  
Next day - Eat plenty. Mostly veg and fish, also other meats, salads, nuts and seeds and stuff. Nice mushroom coffee. Not crazy amounts of carbs but a decent amount. Same morning run (2k) and some stretches, let the body rest and build.  
Then repeat Day 1and repeat, repeat.  


This is based on an alternate day fasting approach which I find works well for me at this time in my life. It also is good for maintaining Growth Hormone which helps the body put on muscle, shed fat, restore a bunch of balances related to the microbiota, cortisol for focus, etc..

Since then, I've lost about 45 pounds and feel much better overall. I can walk for more than 5 minutes without sharp pains in my shins and no longer run out of breath walking from the car to my apartment.

Progress: https://imgur.com/v1PQeTv
Face: https://imgur.com/Ab69roK

For most of the 8 months that the weight loss occurred, I followed an 8/16 schedule, eating between 12PM and 8PM, supplemented by significantly lower carb intake. However, I've been stalled for the last 3 months or so, hovering around 160lbs. 

The only change I made was a slightly higher carb intake on the advice of my doctor. I don't track it super carefully, but went from about 30g per day to 50-60g per day, give or take. I have maintained the fasting schedule for the most part, hoping that it would be enough to compensate for the increased carbs and continue the weight loss, but it so far that's not the case. 

I am planning on working harder on getting excersize, but have never been great at self-motivation.

5233,35/F/227 lbs,"I really need some advice. I've tried different diets and intermittent fasting but always fall off fairly quickly. However, IF seems more doable for me. Except, I feel like it isn't working. I'm only on day 13 so obviously I don't expect much but I thought I would have at least lost 1 lb by now. Prior to IF, I never worked out, ate terribly and often, and never drank water. When I say I didn't drink water, I mean not a single glass.

It's a constant routine of reducing caloric intake, choosing better options, lose weight for a bit, start to plateau, continue to plateau, ok how long is this plateau going to last? Then re-adjust the numbers, change deficit, move more, lose weight, start to plateau again, constantly think about food, think about calories. Etc, etc, etc. 

Ok, maybe I'm not that extreme but I'm constantly thinking about food and my weight. I just want to eat what I want and how much I want and not think of it, but I can't because I dislike how I look. So, I'm not happy with how I look, I'm not happy with how much I eat. Why is 2200 calories enough to sustain my weight but not enough to satisfy me? 

I'm at the point where I'm starting to hate food because of how much I like it. I just want to eat to satisfaction and not care calories, while losing weight at the same time and I know I can't have both. 

I don't know what to do. Maybe I should just give myself a month of IF without thinking about food? I never thought about food (like I do now) before I started my weight loss journey.

My goal was to loose weight but I am finding additional benefits.  

1. The main one is mental clarity.  I am able to focus and be more present.  I have started to remember tons very specific things from my past that I could not recall before changing my diet. 
2. I am also experiencing constant energy.  No more energy swings, no more mid day slumps.  I am able to recover from a workout very quickly (yes, I workout while fasting)
3. I am feeling renewed.  Physically I feel 10 years younger.
4. Inflammation is down.  This is a big one...  Before this diet I did not realize I was constantly inflamed.  My legs were always sore and I always had knots in my muscles.  I just thought this was part of getting older.  This has drastically diminished.  If I get sore/knots they are now temporary. 
5. Sleep.  I am getting better quality sleep and sleeping less.  I just wake up refreshed and ready to go.
6. And I have lost 8 pounds in 3 months

I am not sure why all these things are happening but I am not going back.  I am in my 40s and have changed my diet for good.  I plan on working up to OMAD 5-6 days a week with 2-3, 24-48 hour fasts per month.

5275,Know the difference between IF and eating disorders.,"As someone who once ate as a hobby and lost control of my weight because of it, I absolutely see the merit of IF.

As someone who also happens to work in mental health, I'm also aware of what a slippery slope it can be for some people into disordered eating, an issue that can seriously affect your mental health. 

Know the difference and get help if IF:

- Is causing you to lose/affect important relationships you care about. I'm not talking about the odd person being a little judgmental because they've never heard of IF before; I'm talking about friends/family consistently expressing concern or dropping you altogether. I'm talking about missing out on important social events (weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, celebrations) just because food will be around. A rich and meaningful life includes strong bonds. Give those equal priority to your fitness/wellness goals.

- Is causing you to experience intense feelings of guilt/shame/fear about food. You need food to live. You're not improving your quality of life in the least if you're skinny but feeling anxious all the time.

- Is causing you to faint or worsens your health (frequent headaches/migraines, getting sick more often, extreme fatigue, etc.). I understand that adjusting to IF can cause these symptoms at first, but if they persist, LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND ADJUST. Also no sense in putting other people's lives at risk just to be skinny (ex: feeling weak or difficulty focusing while you drive)

- Is causing you to plummet to unhealthy weights for your height or is causing you to lose weight too quickly. You want something you can be consistent with.
Otherwise your body might overcompensate with binging the moment you let your guard down, followed by feelings of failure/guilt/shame/frustration, then extreme restriction again. That is literally disordered eating. IF should be something you can sustain and that leads to feeling better about yourself and more engaged with life, not the opposite.

These are the main red flags I look for. I'm not saying you have to scrap IF altogether, but maybe talking to a therapist or a dietician who knows about IF could help. A healthy and fulfilling life is WAY more than the number that shows up on the scale. IF done right will help your feel empowered, not trapped.

5281,Anyone here with Nickel Sensitivity and notice Fasting helps?,"TL;DR: Have 72hr fasts help your nickel-related excema? K heard down the grapevine, fasting can reset your ""nickel bucket"" (i.e. deplete nickel from your system so you are at least for a time, less sensitive).

3 years ago, I learned my excema was due to a nickel sensitivity. (For those of you who don't know, Nickel is found in food. Google Low-Nickel Diet for more info).

I struggle with low-nickel because I also have celiac disease (can't eat gluten) and really don't want to eat animals (animals are low in nickel).

I have managed a 21hr fast so far. Slowly working my way up to 72 hrs. I have noticed that if I intermittent fast while taking Zyrtec each day and taking vitamin C when I eat higher nickel-foods, my excema is ""in-the-realm-of-tolerable"".  Definitely still itchy but I'm not ""itching to the bone"".",intermittentfasting,1649249005

Yesterday was my second complete day of fasting so I should eat again today, the problem is I don't want to. I am now nearing 48 hours since my last meal but I am not feeling hungry and I have passed the low blood sugar phase where I am constantly cold so I am quite comfortable in my current state and have no reason to force myself to eat.

I am also confused about calories- like, the idea is to eat the entire days worth (up to, say, 1200) within that window, even if it's omad, right? But what if that feels like too much, or too little, on any given day?

5300,Lack of appetite,"I‚Äôve been doing IF 20/4 since November.  I have hit my goal in the last week (woohoo!) and lost over 40 pounds (IF is the bomb).  I have been a bit worried because there are many days I have a complete lack of appetite now.  Some days I literally have to force myself to eat.  

I‚Äôm not really looking to get thinner.  I could definitely tone up but for now I‚Äôm fine with being skinny fat.  As someone who many moons ago (like over 20 years) had disordered eating, I am very clued in to the fact that I‚Äôm not taking in enough calories right now for someone that doesn‚Äôt want to lose anymore weight.

I thought when I hit my goal I would extend my eating window or IF mon-Friday and open up the weekends to eating whenever.  I‚Äôm having trouble both with being any less rigid with my eating window and feeling hunger.

This whole time I have not restricted fat or carbs (Keto would never ever work for me) and I haven‚Äôt counted calories so I am not restricting to a certain number of calories.

As someone in my 40‚Äôs I would like to avoid falling back into disordered eating of my youth.  I‚Äôm just not sure where to go from here?  Do I just make myself eat whether I‚Äôm hungry or not?  How do I stop the weight loss without giving up IF?  

Seems like a silly problem to be complaining about.  I‚Äôm just really not sure how to transition back to maintenance and having a complete lack of appetite is not helping.",intermittentfasting,1649220004
5301,An Energy Question Of A Different Kind,"Ok. Some background. I was roughly 65 pounds overweight about a year and a half ago. I dropped carbs almost entirely from my diet for a year, and got right down to the middle of my BMI. Excercise, healthy eating, all that good stuff. 

Now. I never experienced anything all that great from keto except weight loss. No extra energy or anything else people talk about. 

On a whim, I decided to tinker with my diet some more and wanted to try intermittent fasting. I've been doing 16/8 for a week, and it is... Different. I've suddenly been waking very easily and feeling less tired in the evenings. I had been struggling to stay up past 10 or so (pre Keto I would regularly stay up till midnight or so) and I always felt groggy waking up (around 7:30 or 8). Because of the weight loss I was willing to put up with these changes. I figured it had something to do with not having access to easy energy like sugar and such. 

On IF these symptoms went away completely. Very strange. I also experienced a little vertigo the first two days. May have been a blood sugar thing, maybe not, maybe just some sort of psycho-somatic deal. But I've been feeling great. 

However. Occasionally throughout the day, I feel a little jittery. My theory is that my caffeine intake (tea and coffee) is very high and that formally I didn't feel it that much because I constantly had food in my belly to slow it down. Now much of the day it's just straight up coffee going in on an empty stomach. Like drinking alcohol without having eaten. Doubly effective. 

Now here's the question. Do you think the ""excess"" feel good energy I've had might be entirely due to my more effective caffeine intake? Most of what I've seen is people complaining about being tired after fasting, not energetic. Does this make sense? I think I'm going to back off to a cup of coffee in the morning and a cup of tea with lunch and dinner (which are the two meals in my window) and see what that does. I don't want my energy to be caffeine dependent, I just always felt like caffeine didn't do that much for me, but maybe that had to do with never having an empty stomach.",intermittentfasting,1649219353

I'm doing this to see if it would affect my autoimmune issues and back pain/old injuries and it's been a massive success, I no longer have any back pain fasting for this long, and my autoimmune issues are going away.

The issue is that it's basically spiked my blood sugar much higher than normal. My old numbers on a 18.5 hour fast were a 75-78 fasting blood glucose. My fasting blood glucose is now 98 which is horrible. I don't understand how this could happen and how 2 hours could affect my blood glucose so much. These numbers were taken after 13 hours fasted, and no my carb intake or diet did not change at all, despite the blood glucose increase I've managed to lose more bodyfat and get very lean.

Would taking the blood glucose test 2-3 hours before eating giving me a more accurate reading on my blood glucose? Does anyone know why this is happening?

5355,I'm never hungry?,"Starting doing IF on the 26th of March. I did about 12/12 the first day to test it out, then 16/8 and around a week ago I started with 17:7.

I am realising I'm actually never hungry?

I'm not counting the calories I eat because I get obsessive over it and I used to have eating disorders. I used to struggle with snacking. So I want to give myself freedom to eat while on my eating window. 

I usually start with breakfast (usually flakes + vegan yogurt, or a sandwich with cheese and vegan ham). Sometimes I'll do a protein shake. Sometimes coffee and toast.

Then usually I'm not hungry for lunch because I start eating at around 10 am. So sometimes I'll have soup, sometimes I will snack on something light. 

Then for dinner if I remember to prepare something I'll do a veggie wrap or a rice based plate or something like that. Sometimes pizza I'm not gonna lie. But most times I forget so I end up having breakfast food. 

I am eating veggies everyday though and plenty of water and I'm trying to exercise a few times a week.

But the thing is I usually just feel a bit hungry at around 8-9 am and then I just won't feel hungry. 

I'm eating because I want to and not because I have to.

5360,OMAD + Water Fasting + Calorie Counting + Walks,"Hello guys,

 I am looking to lose around 100 pounds, I am not able to afford going to the gym right now for many reasons, I was wondering if the plan I present here could work out. 

***Notice;*** (I already did a week or so of water fasting last year and it went pretty well I would say.) 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I noticed during the last month or so that I lose and gain weight very easily, I can drop 2 kilos (4.4lb) in one to two days or gain it based on what I eat. I do not know what kind body / metabolism type I have but as I said I gain and lose weight very easily / quickly.   
I also lost 10kg (22lbs) in a week because anxiety was coming back and I only ate a meal or so per day, not felt any hunger whatsoever and didn't felt bad because of it.  


Since a little bit of time I've had this realization of how much I want to change, to love myself more, to be able to be socially comfortable (I am currently not and have anxiety disorders) my weight making me even more scared of being social, to have a better health, a better way of thinking and overall just enjoy life way more than I did for the last 2-3 years of being obese.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently heard about OMAD *(One Meal A Day)* 

Knowing that water fast have too much risk and is way too extreme, I really liked the idea about OMAD and thought about what if I mix OMAD and Water Fasting with my metabolism. 

What I mean by that is starting with OMAD than slowly doing a day of Water Fasting a week, than 2, than 3, than alterning between the two everyday.

This would be way more simple and secure than a water fasting for me;

Adding calorie count to that without it being too much (I want to eat just enough, not too much, not too little) during OMAD.

&amp;#x200B;

So with a pretty fast metabolism + OMAD + Calorie Counting + Water Fast + Some walks throughout the week that I usually do. Do you think it is possible and not too extreme?, as of for me I know my own body and think that this is a good plan that I can handle. 

If I do this in how much time do you guys think I should be able to lose this 100 pounds &amp; is it safe?

Thankfully I Am so far... But do you know what my surprisingly second favourite benefit is...?

I love the taste of food again.

5414,How critical is the 24-hour cycle?,"Hi all, fairly new to the lifestyle so I‚Äôm reaching out now to avoid developing bad habits with my IF. I started two weeks ago with 16:8 with no dramas. Fairly easy adjusting but I still give in to donut cravings and the like but trying to limit total calories for the day. After listening to Dr Fung, I realised I need to focus on insulin response more than total calories, so I‚Äôve started a fat fasting diet today hoping to kick the carb cravings altogether and eat mostly clean throughout this journey. 

I‚Äôm finding though that my goal posts have been changing almost daily the last week. I would aim for 24hours fast then by hour 18 given in to hunger (which I‚Äôm hoping to address with fat fasting). But sometimes I don‚Äôt want to wait the six hours to total the 24hr cycle for the next fast so I decide to give myself only a 2 to 4-hour eating window and start my fast early. I try to aim again for 24hours but the next day I could end up only with 21hours but depending on what happens, I could give myself a longer eating window than the day before like 6 hours. Then fast for possibly 16 or 18 etc (have not exceeded 21 hours so far). Is this somewhat erratic approach okay? Is maintaining a fasting window of at least 16 hours or over for weight loss more critical than the hours I give myself for the eating window or is it essential for getting the full benefits of IF to respect the 24-hour fasting and feeding cycle?

Sorry if this sounds silly, I may just be over-thinking this. My goal is definitely to be more disciplined and follow a stricter 24-hour cycle for days or weeks before I decided to change it up again to another structured 24-hour cycle. But for now, am I still benefiting from this erratic approach? I haven‚Äôt lost weight in the past two weeks but I have also been doing weight training.

When I think of OMAD I feel like it could feel like an unhealthy version of fasting, at least for me. Are your one meals giant?

Idk. I've struggled with disordered eating patterns since my weight became an issue in my early 20s due to medications I was on and have come a long way since.

But as far as I can see, people can still lose weight by eating 3 or more times a day but with less food.

5484,Would 12:17 be sustainable? [F21],"When I first started my weight loss journey, my heaviest weight was 205 pounds. The lowest I had gotten was 124, I had lost about 81 pounds! My goal weight had been 130.

Well, at some point, I had stopped being strict on myself and stopped caring with the excuse of 'I'll lose it later, no worries!' I ended up gaining back nearly 30 pounds. (28)

I want to go back to my former routine, but I have questions on if it was healthy or sustainable or not!

I'm about 5'3 or 5'4 and currently weigh 152.4 pounds. I know I can lose it easily if I stay away from the junk food and unhealthy snacks.

Before, I would wait until around 12PM to eat breakfast. Usually a small bowl of cornflakes. I haven't been eating any cereal for a long time now. Then I would wait around 5:30PM or 6PM to eat dinner. (Usually a portion sized microwave meal, a bowl of soup, one large piece of meat, a salad, etc.) For a while, it was just that, though after I had taken a few dizzy spells and fell in the bathroom two or three times at night, I started eating healthy snacks around 9PM or 10PM. (A small cup of yogurt, a little bowl of grapes, some baby carrots, a cup or two of sugar free jello, etc.)

 After I got on my ADHD medicine, it's like anything that takes effort or that I ate before has little appeal to me now. My willpower has went down, but I want to try and get back on track.

I would like to go back to maybe eating breakfast at 12PM and dinner at 5:30PM or 6PM. That, or skip breakfast and lunch and wait until maybe 4-5PM to eat dinner, and maybe a snack around 6, 6:30PM, or 7PM. (My medication helps me go through part of the day without eating, though I start to get hangry around 4, 4:30PM.  


(I did exercise for a long time when I first started, though when I got around probably 160-150, I realized I didn't need to exercise to lose it and stopped with it, since it exhausted me and I got more hours for work.)

Others in comments felt so sad about themselves for not being able to achieve the same results


That‚Äôs because, the posters had weight loss surgery and they were hiding this aspect. WLS makes you eat less, especially for the first half a year. You often eat under 800-1000 calories, you don‚Äôt feel huge hunger as before and you can go many hours without eating. 

This is simply dishonest to not mention it, but to say you could ‚Äòfast‚Äô 20 hours a day or to fast for few days. 


I have a WLS surgery. And I see the differences. I can easly fast a week if I want now. We are given supplements and vitamins. 

Life is hard with WLS too, you can develop serious deficiencies and we ‚Äòsurvive‚Äô and strict supplements especially the first few months. 

Mentally speaking, it‚Äôs the same hard struggle with food. 

But physically speaking, the stomach isn‚Äôt killing you if you don‚Äôt eat huge amounts, every minute if your life. 



So please, be careful what people you admire on this subredit. 
Some are honest and they do such a great job. 

Some hide their WLS and want to inspire normal people to have a lifestyle similar to them. But this lifestyle identical to theirs  is not sustainable for a person who didn‚Äôt have surgery.

5534,The Most Keto-Friendly Nuts,"The keto diet, short for ketogenic diet, has become a very popular diet due to its purported health benefits and its ability to help people lose unwanted body fat.

While on a keto diet, individuals significantly restrict their carbohydrate (carb) intake to about 10% or less of their dietary intake while increasing their consumption of fat. Consuming large amounts of dietary fat coupled with restricting carbs causes your body to enter a state of ketosis. Ketosis is when your body stops using sugar (glucose) for energy and instead, breaks down fat into ketones to be used for energy.

Individuals on the keto diet are usually on the hunt for high-fat foods that also contain minimal carbohydrates. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be tricky and difficult; it can be even more tricky if you're practicing both intermittent fasting and keto because of how restrictive your diet is.

Many nuts are low in net carbs (total carbohydrates minus total fiber), while being high in fat, making them an excellent choice. Nuts are also very nutrient-dense as they contain protein and high amounts of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

Getting through my fast is super easy for me, eating is the hard part.

5589,IF/GBT - Intermittent Fasting with Glucose-Based-Timing,"I used IF successfully 2 years ago to lose a ton of weight.  Then Covid happened. 

Now starting IF again and I know from prior experience how critical blood glucose levels are to weight loss.  Get glucose levels down overall (by fasting) and the weight just falls off.  Walk around snacking and keeping glucose high and the weight just goes right back on.   Extended fasts of 3+ days are awful for me, but I don't mind somewhat frequent 2-day fasts.  Just my preference. 

Two ways to get glucose down:  fasting &amp; exercise.  I need both and need to start doing more of both, so I began to realize that simply waiting (or exercising then waiting) for glucose to hit a certain level seems to make more sense as a ""meal time"" trigger than does conventional meal times on my eating days.  Why not make informed decisions about when to eat by checking glucose levels and respecting them?

That's what I am going to do this time around:  on the days when I am OMAD or eating ""normally,"" my feeding times will be entirely determined by my glucose level.  When I am in the 80s, I can eat.  If I eat low-carb or exercise, I may be low enough to eat another meal later (lunch).  If I watch my portions, I might be in the 80s again later (dinner) and be able to eat.  If my levels are high, I might go on a walk to pull them down and re-measure.   If that doesn't work, I know that I am doing the right thing by not adding fuel to a system that has plenty of fuel circulating -- and tons in reserve.    


Here's what I'm thinking:  
\- Sunday = fast day  
\- Monday = OMAD, but eat ""dinner"" only if/when glucose is 70s-80s  
\- Tuesday = ""normal"" meals only \*when\* glucose is 70s-80s  
\- Wednesday = OMAD, but eat ""dinner"" only if/when glucose is 70s-80s  
\- Thursday = ""normal"" meals only \*when\* glucose is 70s-80s  
\- Friday = OMAD, but eat ""dinner"" only if/when glucose is 70s-80s  
\- Saturday = normal meals only \*when\* glucose is 70s-80s

Yes, this will cost me a bit with glucose monitoring strips: 1-2 strips on OMAD days, 3-4 strips on meal days = 12 - 18 sticks a week, which is $5 - $7 a week.  I can take that.

ESPECIALLY when your days and evenings are a string of social eating events.  

In the opening days of a week long visit of family, I was doing okay. While I strayed from my usual foods, I was being mindful to keep my portions down. Was only a couple of days though of eating out and cooking in before the fridge and pantry were full of food.  And it kept coming too. A birthday, a retirement then, a reunion. And wow, Thanksgiving was still ahead of me. Fortunately, the day time events tend to not involve any alcohol because wow, drinks sure did flow during evening hours. If any of you are like me, drinks leads to drinking more drinks which leads to snacking and inevitably, standing in front of an open fridge putting way too much food in your gut while overindulgence takes the wheel.

I mostly do 20:4, but not strict. My fasting time usually ranges anywhere from 19-22hrs. And I do it every single day. Zero exercise. 

I initially did IF to lose weight (original weight was around 135lbs). Goal accomplished in the course of about 10 months. But now that I'm trying to maintain cause I'm noticing I might even be too skinny, I keep losing weight! I've lost about two pounds in less than a month while trying to maintain. I am not at a caloric deficit. 

For those who switched from weight loss to maintenance, do you eat above your TDEE or as near as that amount as possible? I know I should not be afraid of weight gain at this point, but I'm afraid of eating above my TDEE as I'm not sure how I would mentally react to gaining weight. I just want to stop losing, but reeeeally don't want to stop IF. 

Is it really that hard to maintain with IF without losing any more weight? I don't want to be on my bones, which is pretty much already happening. What would you recommend and why? 

The options I have in my mind are:

1. Stop IF and eat intuitively. - really don't want to go there due to anxious/boredom eating.
2. Continue with IF and eat around 100 calories above TDEE. - not sure this would stop loss.

But even if you restrict yourself to let‚Äôs say, 900 calories a day which is a severe deficit, how is that considered bad? If I fasted for a full 24 hours, wouldn‚Äôt I be at a 1800 calorie deficit anyway? It just seems like CICO doesn‚Äôt apply for fasting requirements. 

How would the rule of making sure I take in enough calories for the day apply? 

Unless I‚Äôm rail thin; severely underweight and skeletal, it wouldn‚Äôt really matter if I‚Äôm at a major deficit, would it? It‚Äôs not like my body would starve. The only downside I could see is a lack of electrolytes, maybe vitamins and minerals, etc. 

Hopefully someone smarter than me has the answer.",intermittentfasting,1638421007

I keep seeing all these posts of great results after only a week and I thought I would have at least lost a pound but nothing. The Fastic app is really helpful cause once I hit the fasting button I haven‚Äôt cheated and I‚Äôm really proud of myself that I haven‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm doing 16:8 but managing to do 18 hours most days, and unintentionally the last few days have been OMAD.  Black coffee and water only whilst fasting, a little Coke Zero during feeding.  I still have to chage my eating habits but I‚Äôm not snacking anywhere like I used to, cut out full fat Coke, drinking more water than I ever usually do.  I worked out my TDEE and I‚Äôm trying to track my calories and so for instance today I‚Äôve eaten about 600 less  than my allowance.


I‚Äôm not ready to give and I know it‚Äôs only been a week and this is actually the most determined I‚Äôve been in a long time but even a small shift on the scales would be nice to see.

I was thinking about getting into the most classic fasting method known to us, or, as I call it, Grandpa Fasting: not eating after 6 pm.

5632,"What are you thoughts on ""You were always beautiful response"" to weight lose?","I've seen a lot of responses to weight lose, specifically on TikTok, with people responding with ""You were always beautiful"", ""You were pretty before, now your skinny too"", etc. I've also seen plenty of comments dogging men for not wanting to date them when they were obese, but now showing interest because they are skinny.

Personally I think it's B.S. I understand people are overweight due to medical issues, or external circumstances, I went through this myself, but for the most part people are overweight because they have a serious problem with food. You wouldn't tell a recovered alcoholic that they were beautiful during their alcoholism. Before our weigh lose we were all using food as an escape. We all had a serious issue that was realized and fixed. Addiction isn't beautiful or desirable. Dogging men for not dating you when you look like you wouldn't make it past 30 is ridiculous. People want to date someone who takes care of themselves, because it reflects how they are going to take care for their partners.

5635,NSV: lab work this week lower A1c,"38F, 5'11"" / SW: 211 lb / CW: 187 lb / GW: 175

I started IF three months ago after a terrible A1c result - 8.1 -  the highest I've had since diabetes diagnosis 15 years ago. My weight was also almost the highest it has been in the same time frame, and the idea of taking more insulin / gaining more weight was not super fun, but I also couldn't just do nothing and risk the health issues of hyperglycemia.

I've been following 16:8, with about a month of 18:6 and a few 20:4s sprinkled in. I've also always been pretty active (more for mental health reasons than anything) but now I make sure to work out 5+ days a week (Peloton bike, strength training, walks, starting some cardio boxing). 

So far, I've lost over 20 pounds, so it is definitely working there. But because of the diabetes and taking a basal insulin I had to figure out some things early on so I wouldn't crash or spike too much. I actually have reduced my daily basal insulin by over a third and figured out the best timing, but it was a bit of a process and was worried that some of the spikes would reflect in my lab work.

Well, my doctor requested a follow up A1c this week... And my result was 5.8! I am floored by the progress I've made. And how easy it really has been, versus all the diets I've tried in the past. I still try to eat lower carb, but do cheat sometimes (Thanksgiving apple pie, looking at you)... and my blood sugar has been OK regardless. And I have more energy / don't get hangry like I used to. 

So - for anyone else on this journey for health related reasons - keep showing up for yourself. It works!  Even if you cheat occasionally, even if you are not clean fasting all the time (I still put cream in my coffee some mornings). You will hopefully be as surprised and delighted at the results as I was this morning. 

I'm in it for the long haul now, but I have a new goal now though - to get off my insulin altogether, something I wouldn't have thought was possible even three months ago.",intermittentfasting,1638397321
5637,Just a quick question about concentration and energy levels,"I have been doing IF for about 2 weeks now and so far I have dropped from 15st 8lb to 14st 12lb. I am guessing most of this is water retention but the scales are going down consistently which I am really happy with.

I have two slight niggles that I am hoping you guys can advise me on. 1) I am struggling to concentrate or stay focused at work. Sometimes it's through hunger but not all the time will this pass once my body adapts? Is this normal. 2) my energy levels are quite low will this balance out? I am struggling to eat loads during my 4 our window. I find I get full really quickly.

I am doing either 20/4 or OMAD. My diet isn't amazing but I am really working on trying to eat whole fresh foods and plan on trying to do 20 mins of exercise every morning to see if that helps.",intermittentfasting,1638395560

Unfortunately, I fell off the wagon and am now bigger than I have ever been.  I am approaching 50 and need to find a better approach to weight loss.

I really think I need to be more educated in my current health and have the support of a physician (keeping up to date on my vitals via blood tests and being a partner in this journey).

I also feel like I need some kind of support group to keep me accountable and motivated. I had been a member of Weight Watchers in the past and I think the meetings kept me more involved than going alone.

I am probably twice the weight I should be and EVERYTHING is difficult for me.  Sleeping, going the bathroom, getting out of a chair.  It is overwhelmingly depressing and embarrassing.

I felt nauseous while/after eating breakfast) I would be ravenously hungry before coffee break at 10am and would be hungry again before leaving work after eating lunch at 12pm. I have a physically taxing career and would try my best to make sure I brought quality food and drank water during the day, but I would still have this incredible hunger at different points throughout the day, every day.

These days I practive 16:8 with some 20:4 on the weekends here and there. I get up at the same time, drink a cup of black coffee, and eat my first meal between 10am and 11am. I have an alarm set for 11am because I'm able to busily work away all moring without thinking about food and sometimes wouldn't realize my fast was over. I'm also a lot less hungry in the afternoon and am able to get by with a small snack when I get home from work to tide me over until dinner.

He was losing a lot of weight because whenever he ate he would get intense pain.  So we tried a few supplements that received glowing reviews on Amazon.  I know it's purely anecdotal but he was desperate.  After a few days, his symptoms subsided.  After a week it was all gone.  Fortunately, he had some of the supplements leftover which I took.  Again, my symptoms started getting back in just a day.  This is what I took, [Dr. Berg's Gallbladder Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Gallbladder-Contains-Indigestion-Abdominal/dp/B00HSC5IR8).

I've been exercising about half an hour a day everyday, with 1-2 rest days per week, for a few months. I can just barely see results in the mirror but I can tell I am gaining some muscle.

I haven't weighed myself because I have a history of ED and unhealthy body image obsession (chalk it up to bullying as a kid from other kids and my own parents), and weighing myself and putting a number on my body just puts me in a bad headspace instantly. Just know that I am chubby.

I don't know if I can do keto right now because while I can probably eat less carbs, the idea of eating a ton of fat and protein daily is scary to me lol. I'm vegetarian and not sure how I'd even be able to do that.

For the next month it is just the 8 hr eating window. Not trying to overwhelm myself. I have a bad habit of trying to change everything on day 1 and not being able to maintain. I burn out super quick because I am hungry, sore from working out, hungry,  and honestly, a bit hungry. 

I am 4'11 and 177 lbs. I am diabetic so I am probably not going to go for longer fasts. I tried 20:4 previously and it was not great. I am hoping that I will have results from consistent 16:8. 

I know I should do pictures but I really hate looking at my body and when I look at them I get very sad and even more hungry. 

Comfort food is not a category for me, more an action and just trying to fill the hole in my soul with carbs and sugar. Hence, diabetes. 
I could comfort myself with ice cream or fruit, either way it is gonna be a lot of mindless chowing down. 

Also I hate exercise. God, it is the fucking worst.  I know endorphins and accomplishment and it hurts so good... Except no. I hate being sore. I have autoimmune arthritis condition so everything hurts most days. It just does. 
But wait, there is a perfect exercise program that will cause me no pain and the weight will melt off. Get thee behind me, Satan. You are lying&amp; also I already paid $249 for that shit. I don't like it. Maybe at some point but not today.

I don't use a scale normally but I can tell that I gained pandemic weight because my clothes don't fit anymore and I'm larger in certain places.

I've used keto a couple times previously and I really enjoy that diet. I drop a lot of weight early in the first two weeks and then it's pretty ok to maintain. I'm aware that's mostly water weight in the beginning but I still look better and feel better when on keto. The problem with keto for me is that it's really difficult to keep it up while visiting friends and going out to eat together. 

So I've seen many women in this subreddit with similar body shapes as me and they lose weight with casual 16:8, so I've been trying it too. The last seven or so weeks (plus before Christmas) I've been doing 16:8 every weekday and then been eating normally on weekends. I cannot continue fasting on weekends because eating breakfast with my partner on weekend mornings and drinking wine together in the evening is a way too large life quality for me to give up. I need those moments for my own sanity in this crazy world.

I eat dinner around 7 or 7:30pm and make sure to not eat anything after 8pm. Then I don't eat anything again until 12 pm next day. Except for drinking water, chamomile tea with no cal sweetener, and half a glass of those Gatorade zero sugar drink mix in the morning. Maybe also one sugar free extra gum.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my smart scale's graph of my weight.  Guess when I started IF. 

F64, heart and ortho issues, high blood pressure, pre-diabetic.

Feb 4 weight was 350.4 lbs.

I started IF on Feb 20, with 16:8 and worked my way up in 5 days to 20:4.  This week I started an alternating schedule of 20:4/44:4.  I haven't been hungry since the first day. 

I do very little exercise, about half mile walk twice a week.  Yesterday I took out the bicycle for a 1.5 mile ride and plan on riding every day the weather is nice.  

My main food vice was giving up ice cream and sorbet, and being home all day meant that I was eating more often.  Now instead of ice cream I eat whole fruits.  I still eat a lot, but I seem to be making better choices.  My daily calories runs around 1500 during my 4 hour eating periods.

I'm thinking of varying my fasting schedule as I go. Maybe do 20:4 with a longer fast once or twice a month.  I'm hoping that the autophagy does its job.  I'm waiting until the end of the month to do more blood work.

Ever since I started fasting like 6 years ago I'm finding McDs food just tastes like garbage. Before that I must've gone to McDs 4 times a week, at least. I was addicted to their fries in particular. Since I started fasting, every couple of months I'd get a craving for McDonalds (must be a brainwash thing) and I am ALWAYS disappointed and I end up throwing the whole meal out after a couple of bites. The fries and the nuggets taste like cardboard. The hamburgers tastes like the paper it's wrapped in.

I don't think it's a fast food thing either because I still eat the hell out of In n' Out, Jack In The Box and Taco Bell. It's just McDonalds that is absolutely unpalatable. I just hit the drive thru an hour ago and got a 10-pc McNuggets combo and I threw it away after eating like one nugget and a few fries.

I'm a 24 year old male college student, checking in at 6'5 (1,95m) and 218lbs (99kg).

My current goal are 200 lbs (91kg), getting rid of the fat and building some muscles again.

I tried intermittent fasting in 2019 to avoid my late night snacks while gaming with great success, but my situation has changed now that i gained some weight and I am seeking some Advice for my upcoming IF plan.

1. Is a 16/8 split a good choice when trying to cut down body fat while working out or wold you recommend something else?

2. My current training schedule consists of soccer practice every monday/wednesday 8PM - 10PM and basketball practice on thursdays 6PM to 8PM. 

I think I won't be able to come back from my practice sessions at 10PM without having something to eat so I need to find a good timing for my 8 hour window.

Will having my last meal after 10PM slow down my body while fasting or is the timing rather irellevant?

3. Should I rather focus on my protein intake while not fasting or should I just stick with avoiding sugar for the fat loss journey?


I'm thankful for all of your replies in advance and am looking forward to my journey on here! :)",intermittentfasting,1646271266

Those who do OMAD, how do you get all your calories in one meal...that feels like so much food if you're not eating pizza or other junk? I'm trying not to overwhelm myself with calorie counting because for me, that always leads to failure.

5845,Were any of you originally on your way to have weight loss surgery but decided not to and went with IF instead?,"I'm struggling as I am approved for the sleeve. I wanted it for YEARS. I'm about 37, 3 kiddos, 5'4 (HW: 265 CW: 253 GW: 160 (then 140) ...pre-diabetes (A1C 5.7 but I'm very symptomatic..sensitive body I guess), sleep apnea (insomnia from SA which makes life suck..although it has improved somewhat.. AHI 16..so not bad but it's there) and my PCOS is pretty flared up.. lots of plucking and male pattern hair loss.. Nobody notices but me..thank goodness I had thick hair before or I'd be bald.  


Almost all of these could be ""cured"" just losing weight. I've had tons of discipline and I actually am a ""weirdo"" and love counting calories. SUPER easy for me.. I keep an app.. I'm sort of OCD and neurotic (type A) so I like the control and I already can eyeball mostly everything without measuring or anything as I've done it so long.  


As I became bigger and more insulin resistant (and my estrogen got lower.. either due to age or me worsening my PCOS with weight gain).. it has become harder to stick to calories .. THEN I started IF.. I did 18:6.. and for 3 weeks out of the month it is TOTALLY doable.. the week leading to period my estrogen drops and I'm damn hungry.. so I don't do it but I promised I wouldn't just blow it.. During IF I stay around 1,700 cals per day (I will eventually lower this of course).. week up to period I stay under 1,900.. I'm a little hungrier and it's hard to manage but not fasting makes it doable to not screw up my progress.. I accept that 3 weeks out of the month I'll have progress and the 4th week I'lljust maintain.  


I've noticed whenever I get over 220s my body is ""hungrier"" and getting over that initial hump and (I guess) leveling out my blood sugar, insulin/hormones..is harder due to the hunger and stuff.. It seems like once I slip right to 200.. I'm on a roll..   


With IF, I was doing it to fix my A1C..then I went to the doc office and they weighed me and I'd lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks (despite being bloated as I was DAYS away from my period.. and I usually weigh a few pounds more leading up to that and then lose it). I thought WOW.. I'm having 1700 cals of food ..not working out.. my metabolism STILL works..and I lost 6 pounds..I even had like 2 days I ate too much..   


I thought to myself.. this means if I just stick to it 95% of the time, I should have no issue losing 12-15 pounds a month the first 4 months or so (and that's likely because I'm heavier)...When you compare this to the sleeve.. and the fact in 8 months many people who do REALLY well have lost 100 pounds.. that's 12.5 pounds per month.. It almost seems like if I just kept on doing IF, I could do the same.   


I'm really struggling as I worked hard to knock out every step to get this surgery and I have spent around $800 between copays and apps and special appts.   


Have any of you here with great success originally been on the road to having weight loss surgery but decided to stick with IF instead? If so, can I know your stats, how much you started at.. what you lost..how long it took.. and if you had any regrets at all?  


I'm an inch away from ..first.. delaying my surgery for another 6-8 weeks (to give myself to keep trying this newfounded IF that seems to be working for me)...and possibly canceling it altogether if I get closer to that new surgery date in 6-8 weeks and still see the IF is working for me.",intermittentfasting,1646233895

I did this through the keto diet. However, when COVID hit, I lost all control and have since regained EVERY pound, plus a couple. My weigh-in prior to starting IF was 180.6. That was the moment I knew it was time to get back to work on my fitness and health goals. 

I did IF about 9 months ago and was seeing some really great results, but then I took a new job, My job change caused me to fall off IF because I was less busy/active during my fasting window so I was feeling famished and literally starving every day. At my previous job, I literally had NO time to think about food so this was quite a drastic change. 

Anyway - I am officially back to fasting doing 20:4 fasting. I fast from 8 PM to 4 PM and then I eat one big meal, have a healthy snack or two, and drink a diet coke as a treat.

5870,My journey so far," 

**Start**

I started at 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 230# which shocked me when the chart showed I was Obese.

**Phase 1**

I cut out sugar, processed food, eating out and started to walk which got me to 180# where I was stuck.

**Phase II**

I started Keto and was pleased with the initial water weight loss and hunger suppression that got me down to 170# where I was stuck again. I am shooting for &lt; 50 carbs. Breakfast is two eggs, two slices of bacon, and a little broccoli or cauliflower, maybe some cheese. Dinner is beef and some low-carb vegetables. I snack a little on nuts. Chicken does not seem to have enough fat for me to not get hungry. I am stuck at #170.

I have been very pleased with my metrics - blood sugar, blood pressure, etc. My brain is fog-free. My total Cholesterol (expected?) has shot up but my HDL (good) has increased for the first time in my life.

**Phase III**

Because I am not as hungry on Keto I have been trying IF. I started with eating at 10am and 6pm. Slowly I have been eating the first meal later and later. I am up to noon and 6PM.  I think I want to get to OMAD at 6 PM??

**Phase IV**

If needed, I am mentally preparing myself for 24hr or longer fasts.

IF: 
 ‚ÅÉ Fast 18hrs with 6hr eating window.
 ‚ÅÉ Fast 16hrs with 8hr eating window. 
 ‚ÅÉ Fast 20hrs with 4hr eating window(more lenient on what you can eat within your 4hrs).
 ‚ÅÉ Eat 1x per day, not recommended for starting out with. 
 ‚ÅÉ Don‚Äôt eat after 7pm.
 ‚ÅÉ Limit sugar to less than 10g per day, if you can do less then do so. 
 ‚ÅÉ Increase water consumption, a lot.
 ‚ÅÉ Count your carbs, especially when starting out.
 ‚ÅÉ Fat will provide you energy just as well as carbs will, it‚Äôs about teaching your body this difference over time. 
 ‚ÅÉ Stay consistent, eat at the same time(s) every day so your body/hunger become scheduled. 
 ‚ÅÉ Increase protein consumption. 
 ‚ÅÉ Increase vegetable consumption, frozen or fresh doesn‚Äôt matter. 
 ‚ÅÉ Meal prep to make eating more straight forward. It‚Äôs easier to stay disciplined if your meal(s) are made beforehand and all you have to do is warm up as opposed to raiding the pantry/fridge when very hungry. 
 ‚ÅÉ Take your time and don‚Äôt get frustrated. There is a learning curve to everything in life and this is no different. Your body will need time to adjust to these schedules. 
 ‚ÅÉ You‚Äôre not competing in a fitness competition, this is about day to day progress. Not starving yourself for quick results that you will most likely rebound from in a few days to a week. 
 - I will sometimes use Stevia extract if I‚Äôm wanting something sweet but don‚Äôt want the addition of processed sugar.
 - There is nothing wrong with a cheat meal if you are adhering to your chosen Fasting window. I typically do 1x/wk so I don‚Äôt feel bitter or like I‚Äôm depriving myself. 
 - Lemon juice and Apple Cider Vinegar not only help curb hunger but are great at stimulating digestion. I will drink a small glass of water with 2Tbsp of Lemon juice and 2Tbsp of ACV before or directly after I eat. It works to prevent bloating  as well. 
 - Make sure you‚Äôre getting enough salt when fasting, low sodium not only contributes to dehydration but can give you cravings for food. 

I started out doing 18/6 then switched to 20/4 fasting window while doing 1 meal/day 4x/wk. My beginning weight was 220lbs and I am now 180lbs. I wasn‚Äôt perfect through this process and there is no need for you to expect perfection from yourself either. Weight fluctuates day to day so do NOT get into a serious relationship with the scale. Judge your success(es) by how well you adhere to your fasting and eating windows, how your clothes are fitting and how you FEEL.

5882,"Finally, I am back","In the last few years, I have really struggled to maintain a strict discipline in doing keto with IF (or OMAD which just came naturally after some time).   


**\*Warning Long Post\***

In 2019, I was working hard in the gym lifting weights, doing clean and fairly strict keto (1:75:24 C:F:P with 25g carb being my personal limit).

I managed to bring my weight down from 138kg to 124kg. Then I went on holiday with an ex. It was a great trip but it came at the cost of many, many treats, desserts and rich sugary and carb-heavy foods. 

At the end of it, I was disappointed in myself for letting the keto lifestyle down and putting on a lot of weight.  I tried to just accept it as a thing that happens and that I had planned beforehand. I planned for me to just get back on with keto when I returned and work it off with the handy tool of keto/IF.

The problem was that sugar has a terrible side effect of the body desiring it and tricking the brain into making excuses... have a little here and there because it won't count and then, well, I had some before so what's a bit more? Until the healthy lifestyle goes out the window and you fall down the rabbit hole.

The major issue with me is that I have had low self-esteem for most of my formative years and into adulthood and just looking at myself made me hate what I am and I wished that I was dead. I started drinking a bit at the end of 2019, 2 months after the holiday. It felt like I was enjoying life and that I could just forget for a moment, all the self-hatred that persisted underneath my every waking day.

This went on for a few months, it's the end of the week and it is normal to have a few drinks to wind down and relax with some movies or anime.

Months passed and my self-hatred grew. I broke my ankle in the summer '19 causing me to fail a module exam and have to resit the year. I tried to get back on keto and IF. But alcohol had a way to back these sit on the backbench. I would eat less on some days but then binge on others. I would retreat from social events not liking what I looked like. Clothes not fitting anymore. The stress of med school plus the ever reoccurring depression and the low self-esteem sent me into a spiral. Stuck at home resting my ankle, I drank more and more often. I sometimes ate healthily and then other times I would binge until it physically hurt. Life, emotions... enjoyment all began to dull and cease.

I know now that the reason for this was to punish myself further for letting this happen, but also I think I wanted to feel something rather nothing.

I started to feel a bit better by March 2020 and my ankle was a bit better. I began making plans to leave university and study at home with distance learning to better take care of myself with family... that's when COVID-19 caused the world to shut down and the flights were stopped, borders closed and I was trapped. This vicious cycle continued most of the year. I hated myself the most at this point, I could not feel happy, I was all alone and  I wanted to just sleep and not wake up again.

By the summer of 2021, I had been suffering alone in silence. I was not able to stay awake more than 6 hours at a time, I would force myself to attend the video lectures and even there I was not mentally fully there. I could not study at all in my own time and when the exams came up I had done no work. At this point, I would wake to sleep and hate myself 24h of a day. I barely left my bed and I felt nothing. I was a shell of my normal self. I quit med school and returned home.

In the past 3 months, I have been working on myself. I have slowly got back to waking up at a normal time. I plan to do things in my day, I am actively looking for a job, I am trying to learn new skills and significantly reduced drinking to almost zero.

**tl;dr**

And finally... to what I am here to post about. I am finally back to doing clean keto (6 days or so) with food tracking (3days) and somewhat frequent gym (1 month around 2-4 times a week lifting weights. I am slowly shifting my eating patterns to 2 meals a day in an IF window of (16:8).

I want to be held accountable.

I want people to talk to me and express their passion for this lifestyle and share with me their achievements and for them to ask about mine too. I want to walk this path with friends and not be alone anymore.

5893,How do you drink coffee so as not to break your fast?,"I have been practicing IF for a long time and had some problems with drinking my morning coffee. So, I was long looking for ways how to maintain my fast making it until 12. I am sharing my solution to this. Please, feel free to advise and share your methods.  


Drinking coffee will not break your fast if you drink black coffee without any additives (sugar, honey, or milk). The reason is black coffee contains low calories (almost 3 calories) and this amount is insignificant to affect your intermittent fasting endeavors.   


But sometimes I like adding some almond milk, Himalayan salt,  cinnamon, nutmeg, or cocoa for as I don't like drinking my coffee flat.  


I also try to avoid drinking coffee on an empty stomach to ameliorate the following outcomes:  
 

1. Digestion disorder
2. Acidity and heartburn
3. Low serotonin levels, anxiety, and depression
4. Dehydration
5. Increased cortisol levels and insomnia

Also, I noticed high stress, anxiety levels after drinking my coffee on an empty stomach right after I wake up. So, this is what I do.

 

* If you are on 14-16 hours of fasting period start your morning with a glass of water. You can even add lemon to your water to make it not only tasty but also beneficial for your immune system. By doing this, you can shut the hunger for some time before the first sip of the coffee. In addition, you will effectively solve diuretic side effects (making you want to urinate frequently) and possible dehydration.

&amp;#x200B;

* Another simple solution is keeping yourself busy after the first spike of cortisol. Consider doing light exercises, short walks with your four-legged friend, or taking a refreshing shower. Physical activity is tightly connected with serotonin production and stress reduction. Can you see how you shrank that one hour before your most-desired cup?

&amp;#x200B;

* But if you are not practicing any type of diet including intermittent fasting, consider having a nutritious breakfast or at least a light snack before disturbing your empty stomach with coffee. This can help you bypass possible digestive disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

* Based on the above-mentioned sleeping schedule, you should drink your coffee from 9 to 11.30. But keep the moderate amount of 2-3 cups a day to avoid the probable harmful outcomes. Moderate coffee consumption is effective for preventing acidity and heartburn.

&amp;#x200B;

* Also, you are maybe well aware that you should avoid drinking coffee after 2 p.m. or 10 hours before sleep. You will fall asleep (though after maybe a long awake hours), yet your sleep will not be sound. By avoiding afternoon coffee you evade insomnia and unnecessary high cortisol levels.  


So,  depending on the time you drink your coffee you can reduce or increase its beneficial impacts.

5896,Need Advice - My Story 148 to 210 pounds,"For all the people here, I am currently 19 years old. I started IF when I was 17, around 180 pounds or so. 

I gave up all sugar at the start and dropped weight amazingly, going down to 166 in a month (mostly water weight) . In the next 4 months with IF ranging from 16:8 to 18:6 I came to 148 pounds. I felt amazing, I was doing cardio to increase my stamina and also doing strength training at home. My sugar intake was very less to none, and I could eat as much home made food as I wanted and I felt my body could burn it efficiently. I was the epitome of health, all my sluggishness and weak immunity went away, it genuinely felt amazing. Even not doing cardio, I was walking everyday and taking sun and I felt amazing. Everything was going well in college and my life and I felt like I finally found something that was working for me, like a life time companion to help me reach my full potential. 

Came the pandemic. Shut down everything.  Staying at home for the next 5 months, then online classes for the next year and onwards. I fell severely depressed due to some eye opening things that happened. Used to have panic attacks every day during early quarantine. I had my reasons and very strong ones. I left intermittent fasting.  I was still eating as much as I did and things were okay, I wasn't picking up weight whatsoever. The problem started when I touched sugar again. I couldn't stop. I can't stop even today. Food became my comfort that makes all my troubles go away. 

1.5 years of depression made me realise a lot of things. I really ruined my mind and my body. I lost a lot of my lean muscle and put on a lot of weight.  Once I got out of depression with the help of friends and family and could feel mentally better, I gave my all for my papers that I had and decided I would work on my body again after them. 6 days after my last paper, I was tested positive for COVID 19. I was grateful to not be hospitalized but still had severe symptoms and it really took the life out of me. I could barely move for 3 months without muscle pain. Today I feel better of course as it's been nearly 8 months since my infection. My plans were ruined and my summer went away just recovering as well as eating. It's like since then, I've gotten out of depression but at the same time I'm now dealing with the consequences of that depression.  It really disheartens me to look back and see myself at such a peak and my current state of the lowest of my life. 

When I got COVID, I was back to being 180 pounds and my weight was not going beyond that. After COVID, my set point has increased to 210 pounds and I am currently still at that weight.  Even recently these past 6 months have been full of trauma for me and I feel really alone. My motivation is my parents who are still here for me. I barely have time for myself or anything as I'm in University right now, and my schedule really tears me apart. 

I really need help and advice as to how to start IF again. Dr. Berg was like an angel for me in the past and in my heart I know his advice helped me tremendously but I just can't watch his or Fungs videos. It just hurts. I can't stop eating. Chocolates, sugary foods in an unhealthy amount. I know it's bad for me on so many levels from blood sugar levels, to gut bacteria health. 

I know what therapy is and it's what got me out of my depression. I know becoming healthier is the way to losing weight which is what is causing my current state of mind. I truly believe that this is the solution to what is holding me back from improving my life, especially as I have big dreams but feel like I'm rotting away. I've never been physically so active in my life but even this is too much. Going back to University in person does motivate me but it's more of a walk of shame.

The benefits of this practice include weight loss, lower blood sugar, ketosis, and enhanced autophagy. To help your body adapt to using body fat for energy, start with shorter fasts and work your way up to longer fasts.

I would really like to be eating breakfasts at 11AM, have some produce/smoothies for lunch around 3-4, and then finish my meals for the day at 8-9PM. However, I am doing IF for the biological benefits, like circadian rhythm regulation, insulin regulation, hormone balance, etc, and its worked well.

What are good vs bad carbs, because I think my diet most of my life has been pretty carb heavy (rice and pasta).

5935,Pros/Cons of 16:8 only on non-workout days,"**Background:** I've been practicing IF for a while, **mainly** because it is an easy way for me to manage my daily calories. With IF I can easily eat at at a deficit or maintenance if I want, and it doesn't take much extra effort to be in a surplus if I'm trying to gain muscle. With ""normal"" eating throughout the day I almost *always* eat at a surplus unless tracking calories, which is mentally draining. But since I've been doing IF, I have enjoyed the extra free time in the morning, the fact that I'm not addicted to eating, the mental clarity, and the possibly health benefits such as reduced blood pressure and resting HR, and the prevention of developing diabetes.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my strength training sessions and conditioning have become a bit harder, and I'm wondering if I will benefit from consuming carbs and whey protein before my training, and whey protein after. This is mainly because when doing heavy lifting and conditioning while fasted, I'm not able to perform at 100%. My pre-workout would be a large banana and whey protein shake mixed with water. Post workout would be whey protein mixed with water. Since I only train about  2-3 x each week, I would do 16:8 IF for 4-5 days, and would break my fast on the other 2-3 days just for the pre and post workout meals.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question(s):**

1) By *not* doing 16:8 for 3 days out of the week, am I reversing or not seeing the health benefits that I mentioned above (lowered colesterol and HR, prevention of diabetes)? Do these benefits only come from 16:8 every single day?

2) By not fasting for 3 out of 7 days, will I be screwing with my hunger and cravings? I have a busy schedule and love that I can go extended periods of time without food. I'm afraid that if I stop my 16:8 schedule that my body will start to be hungry and more ""dependent"" on food.

3) Or, am I just better off to continue what I'm doing? 16:8 - training first thing in the morning and eating from 11-7? Will I really see significant improvements in performance and muscle/strength gain by consuming a pre and post workout protein shake with carbs?",intermittentfasting,1646070626

6005,A fire under my butt - I'm now weighing less than I have in about 8 years,"*No progress pics to show yet, as while I have make some great progress, it's certainly not enough to show any visible differences yet.*

At the mid point of 2017, I returned from London after 10 months and weighed 106kg (234lbs) at 5'9"". My self confidence was fucked and I was at the point where I had to start buying XXL shirts for work so my gut didn't show through the buttons. I was perpetually embarrassed by how I looked and I always felt shit but I committed to making a change, starting with keto and moving to fasting. By December 2017 I had hit 95kg and was feeling like a god.

Then, I don't know why.. But I gave up on it. I missed all the delicious foods I had given up, started thinking that maybe missing breakfast wasn't such a good idea, started confusing keto and IF and put all the weight back on. Over the next few years, it steadily remained around 100-103kg (220-227lbs). I tried the gym, I tried a few other fad diets, but nothing worked.

About 6 weeks ago I went through something akin to a break up. It was pretty horrific and emotionally I was totally fucked for a bit. Then I had a switch flick on in my head and I began looking back through IF posts and looking up the information I needed, and got back into it. I began with calorie counting as well as IF, and that just blasted weight off me like crazy. A month ago I was 100kg, as of 4 days ago I got to 93kg (205lbs). I've maintained it even with having a few junky things over the weekend (date on Friday night, moving house) because I've not been eating till midday and I stop by 9pm (not hard &amp; fast but definitely within those boundaries) and Sunday I do OMAD.

I have goals and I just found a great motivator on/r/fasting from a few months ago where a woman posted up how she would get a haircut or tattoo or new outfit when she reached certain goals, and she had them all written down. It made me really think about what goals I have, and cemented them in my mind.

I'm aiming for 80kg (176lbs) by October 1st, my birthday. And the final 5kg I will lose before December. I've set myself goals for every 5kg (90, 85, 80 and 75) which are mostly ""buy new clothes"" but there's a few other things I need to get on top of as well for my own physical and mental health.

I'm going to book in a DEXA scan for hopefully sometime this month to really see what's going on, and to use it as motivation.

Anyway I know this is a wall of text so thank you to anyone who reads it, and thank you all especially for being here and doing this as well and providing me with inspiration to be the best version of me that I can be.

Now that my weight has reached around 65 kg, I am no longer seeing any progress like the first two weeks. It will always fluctuates to 65.75 then go down to 65.45 the next day then back again to 65.75. I haven‚Äôt weigh myself officially for the fourth week but I am still seeing around 65.75 kg when I checked it the other day.

With the stats above, am I plateauing already? I follow the 16:8 method and even went beyond 18 hours on my third week of fasting. I also do weightlifting 3x per week, so could it be just water retention from the previous day‚Äôs workout?",intermittentfasting,1657026511

Started again a couple weeks ago and even though the hunger still kicks in, I probably have a stronger willpower this time. 
I notice that during my feeding hours I know got the satiety sensation back,  which I thought it was lost. I could keep on eating untill consuming lots of calories without feeling full.  Now I feel full with less food and stop eating.
I feel that my blood glucose is under control, haven't checked it yet but I'm sure it has a lot to do with me not feeling hungry all the time.

Btw, before I was having three meals and two or three snacks, total 2200 to 2400 calories. Now I cut the snacking and try to stay below 2000 cals a day, some days I get only 1500.

6014,"New to IF, lose 6 pounds in 5 weeks?","Hello! After doing some IF research I decided I wanted to try IF. I have a few reasons, one of them being losing about 6 pounds in 5 weeks. (Or anything close to that amount of weight possible within that time frame)   
I'm a woman in my mid forties, about 5 ft 6 small, 115 pounds and I don't have a plan at the moment. I started IF yesterday evening and just broke my fast with a few boiled eggs and a large bowl of (blendered/smooth) bell pepper soup with avocado. I was crazily hungry and had a fuzzy brain after 16,5 hours of fasting. I two weeks off, and I want to start my fasting at 18.00 and have my brunch or lunch at 10 am or 12.00. (Not sure what's feasible here, since I have never tried this before) 

I have a few questions:

Is it possible to lose this amount of weight in 5 weeks time, if not, what is feasible?

Are there hints/tips to fight the gnawing hunger and especially the fuzzy brain? I drank coffee, water with ACV and lots of green tea and water. Previous to fasting, I already drank quite a lot so drinking is not a problem for me. 

Which IF plan would you recommend? I found some info that 16-8 would be the most common, with three meals a day. I've also seen sources recommending 18-6.   
Then there's the 2 meals a day one. Since I don't want to be looking at the clock all the time for my 3rd meal, I am leaning towards two meals a day. But I also don't want to be hungry all the time/have a fuzzy brain so therefore I am slightly leaning towards 3 meals a day. 

I'm also wondering if exercise is strictly necessary and if so, how much would be ok? I have an indoor cycling bike at home, so if need be I can use that one for HIIT/cardio? (I haven't touched that thing in ages LOL)

Also, can IF boost one's olefactory system? This is my main reason for going for IF so spontaneously. The weight loss is just a very very welcome bonus actually, but I reckon that this reddit might not be populated with medical doctors with olefactory-IF experience. :)

Sorry if my first post is a bit lengthy. Looking forward to your advice. :) Thanks!

Last night I did a very intense kickboxing class, the sparring wasn't very hard and I didn't take any real hits to the head, so I'm fairly sure it's unrelated to that. But could be related to the intensity of the workout and fasting?

6047,I have lost 65 lbs! Yay! Now I need help on how to tighten up,"I (38F, 5ft, 180lbs) have been intermittent fasting for about 5 months now. Started IF when my original weight loss program left me plateauing for over a month. I was doing a Healthy Wage challenge and recently won my prize, having lost 65lbs since January 2021. 

I still have quite a bit of belly fat and thigh fat that I still want to lose. So I have started another Healthy Wage challenge, and I am now mostly OMAD except for going 16/8 during certain days during my cycle. My new challenge goal is to lose 40lbs. That will put me at 140lbs, which is still higher than my BMI but won't make me look like a skeleton. 8 years ago I got down to my BMI but looked very gaunt and people constantly told me they thought I had a serious illness.

Now that there's 65lbs less of me in there, everything that is still there has become very jiggly and soft. I usually manage that by wearing shape wear under my new, skinnier clothing. But that can be uncomfortable and I sometimes feel like I am hiding everything I worked for under a tight suit of armor. I need to tighten up my arms, my belly, and my thighs. 

My current exercise is all cardio. I do a lot of dancing and walking. Now that it is summer I also do a lot of swimming and water aerobics. 

I know spot targeting doesn't really work for weight loss. But is there a good way to tighten up my trouble spots? Should I be lifting weights now? Any recommendations on good lifting plans or videos? Do I just have to wait for my skin to catch up?

Stats: 28F 5‚Äô5‚Äù; SW 183; GW 128-135

I am doing between 19:5 and 21:3 most days with the exception of the few days before I start my period when I pull back to 13:11 or 14:10. I am clean fasting - only drinking plain water; black coffee; plain iced tea - no gum, flavoring, lemon, cinnamon, etc 

I keep reading that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre fasting if you binge/don‚Äôt eat healthy during your eating window, and that ultimately you still need to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. 

That makes total sense, but a big part of what drew me to IF and made it feel doable is that I didn‚Äôt have to restrict or eliminate certain food groups (I love dessert.)

I‚Äôve been adding up what I‚Äôm eating, because I‚Äôm basically on OMAD just stretched out over 4 hours, and my calories are landing between 1500-1800 a day, with 1800 being on the high end.

I am overweight. I know I need to loose weight and so do they. I‚Äôm sure if I talk to them they will soften but right now I‚Äôm too mad to speak kindly. 

If I had to talk to them now there would be a giant ‚ÄúF you‚Äù involved. My brother-in-law has recently transitioned. Guess who was 1000% supportive even when I didn‚Äôt understand (I read up)? Me. Who watches the kids while working from my home office so my husband can participate the evening events his job requires as well as the social ones that he would rather not miss. This woman. 

I feel thrown under the bus. And unsupported. My husband is supportive but I always have to explicitly request support for the things he‚Äôs not already on board with. 

Long story short I cut my fast short so it ended up being closer to omad with a larger than 4 hour window approx 6‚Ä¶which I know is better than my previous eating window. 

I think what frustrates me the most is the condescension and presumption that I‚Äôm the idiot in the room. When people hear your doing something different it‚Äôs all judgement.

6111,Any advice please? Alcohol and fasting/weight loss,"I know that I unfortunately have bad alcohol habits especially during the summer, and the over all idea about it - that I drink until I get drunk, more or less. Especially during celebrations and music festivals but yeah, it is a bit too incorporated in my social life. Usually this isn¬¥t really a problem for me, yet anyway, could be long term of course. But during dieting and/or fasting this causes 2 problems;   
1. I think I can stand a lot more alcohol than I can, so even if I think I am taking it slow and not overdoing it I can find myself really hammered. Classic weight loss issue  
2. If I can¬¥t drink beer or cider and such because of the carbs/sugar, that leaves a lot heavier liqour, which will make #1 even harder to deal with.   


So the thing is that I do want to lose a bit of weight as possible this summer or at least avoid gaining weight which is probably more realistic, but is this even possible in a way that don¬¥t hurt my alcohol tolerance too much? Or do you have any other ideas besides going permanently sober?

If I stick to OMAD combined with a more keto approach and very low calorie intake (let‚Äôs say less than or around 1000 a day) then I can lose weight consistently. However, if I go above that and have what I would call a normal meal (so not just a salad and meat but some rice/potatoes or sauce), then I immediately gain back the weight I had lost the next day. 

I don‚Äôt break my fast with anything, I only drink water and plain coffee throughout the day. I might have one or exceptionally two sodas during that ‚Äúnormal meal‚Äù but that is about it.

I don‚Äôt understand where I‚Äôm going wrong. Currently I fast every day but like I said, I might have a larger meal during two or three days a week.

6132,"10 years of IF (f, 38) maintained weight even after 3 children. My thoughts.","Before I started IF at 28, I was obsessed with my weight and dieting. I had mostly recovered from an ED but still occasionally binged and starved myself. I hovered around 53-56kg (117-124lb). I'm 174cm, 5'9"" and have tall skinny parents. My genes work FOR me, not against me. My highest ever weight (non pregnancy) was 125lb, 56kg. 
Then a doctor friend of mine suggested IF. It was pretty new at the time. I remember my first week, I was shaking and sick by 9am but slowly I built up til I reached a IF that worked for me (8pm-12pm/1pm). I then stayed at 52/53kg without having to restrict myself. I could go out for dinner with friends, eat cake at work....I never felt deprived. I never binged. If my weight went up by 1kg I would cut out 'treats' for a week and would go back to my weight. Monitoring is important, I could never be the person 'I just put on 5kg I don't know how that happened!'

I stopped IF every time I got pregnant and during breastfeeding but would start again with delight once baby was fully weaned. 

I do a super light version while breastfeeding, once it is established and baby putting on weight where I have 12 hours of fasting. Baby is usually 4 months old when I start this super light version. 

So I am happily and easily the same weight I was at 18 without the dieting and calorie counting and binging and eating disorders. 

And you know what, maybe once a month or so I go out for brunch and don't do IF, but I realise it's a journey for life so it doesn't stress me out in the least.

6145,Water (?) Weight not coming off at all,"Hi everyone,

For almost 2 weeks now I have been in a weight plateau ever since I came back from a beach trip. Prior to going on the weekend, my weight was around 168-170lbs (I'm a 6ft male for perspective). I knew that with my family I wasn't going to be able to sustain my diet as efficiently so I was more lenient in order to have a good time since I rarely go on vacation. Although I didn't track calories and such, I was still eating 2 meals a day due us being at the beach and not being so hungry in the mornings. So I predict that the usual calories consumed were around my maintenance calories (2100) at worst.

Ever since I came back from my mini vacation, however, my weight has increased to 175lbs. Which was fine at first, as I suspected it was just water weight as it usually spikes that dramatically for me when I eat at a restaurant or a fast food joint. Since I did that for 3 days, I suspected it was going to take a few days or even a week for it all to return to normal.

It's been almost 2 weeks since then and my weight has stayed ***exactly*** the same. As in, my weight has not increased or decreased since then. It'd only change by the decimal after drinking some water. I thought perhaps my scale was broken but a recent visit to the doctor showed the exact same weight I had observed at home which disproves that. Curiously enough, I had ordered some fried chicken and fries yesterday which are very calorie dense and unhealthy. While I was craving it, I was also curious to see if my weight would change at all. I checked my weight the next day after my fasting period ended and it was the same. No reported change.

So, what the heck is going on? On the one hand I'm glad that I can eat something that unhealthy and gain no weight at all. But on the other hand, I suspect that my real weight *is* being affected and I simply can't observe it due to my current water weight (if it even is that still at this point). My body doesn't feel any heavier ever since I left so it's not like the weight can be observed physically as well. 

Is there something wrong with me? Something I should do or check out? Any help would be appreciated.",intermittentfasting,1656797900

6153,Best way to manage IF around high intensity workouts and activities,"Hello All,




I'm looking for some tips and advice around managing IF and high intensity workouts and activities. What IF feeding window timing has worked best for you? For example, how many hours into the fast you start the high intensity workout. Have any types of food or supplements helped you out?




Some background: I have no issues doing moderate excercise during my fasting window, but I am finding that my higher intensity activities are causing me to feel faint and slightly nauseous during the fast. For example, 5km jog at 18 hours into the fast, I have no issue and feel great. But stuff like soccer games, long bike rides with hills, and hiking up steep hills have me feeling unwell when it's too far into the fasting window, and then I break the fast with an emergency snack. I've been experimenting with the timing with a bit of success for the soccer games, but I'm wondering what timing has worked for others or if there are any types of food or supplements that can help. Also, the hiking and biking trips can take all day so it's not like it's a 1 hr HIT workout, it's a full day activity that seems to demand fuel faster than my body can produce during a fast and during the high intensity bits. These activities are my Summer hobbies that I don't want to give up as they bring me a lot of happiness.




My goals: To get visible arm and ab muscles. I'm not sure what weight this would be at so I don't have goal weight. For information, I currently weigh around 137 lbs and am 5'-3"" 31 year old female.

Why lose 10lbs when it‚Äôs not going to make a dent in my health or appearance? It wasn‚Äôt motivating enough for me to put up with the discomfort of changing my eating and exercising habits. It sounds counterintuitive but setting more challenging goals has actually helped me take more drastic action. Which in my case was needed. And that‚Äôs when I finally started seeing results. Although tbh, I find IF to be pretty easy. I might have two moments throughout the day where I get hungry, which passes quickly. I was severely underestimating how much I can accomplish in a year‚Äî let alone a matter of weeks. There are 27 weeks left of 2022. If I lose at a rate of 1.5 a week, I could lose 40 more pounds!

6193,What are your cheat meals like?," 

I‚Äôve been doing IF for about 15 months and was wondering if anyone does cheat meals after a few months time? Or their frequency? most of this time has been combined with low carb

Prior to this health plan, I weighed 241 and was unhealthy and inactive. I‚Äôm 6 feet tall.

Currently weigh 174. Nearly all weight came off in the first year. I workout/lift 5 days a week now and just maintain and try to build muscle. My current eating style is more low carb than keto since some days I incorporate more veggies than allowed which messes with the macros.

Awhile back, I decided to give myself a cheat meal every 90 days. I guess it‚Äôs closer to a binge meal than anything since its a large feast I try to finish. This past weekend I had a cheat meal which consisted of

14 ounces broiled chicken with bbq sauce

2 sweet potatoes with garlic/butter

2 corn on the Cobbs with butter

2 thick chocolate fudge brownies

Small portion of Mac and cheese

Brown rice with garlic

the one 3 months ago

3 Slices of Pizza from my favorite pizza place

6 grilled chicken wings (breaded)

3 peanut butter cookies

3 pieces of cheese bread

\-

I usually eat something like this for a meal every 3 months. I started doing this after 9 months of very strict keto and IF (16/8 or 18/6).

Prior to these cheat meals, I usually get really high to enhance the taste.

The only notable thing is I haven‚Äôt felt sick or get crashes after my cheat meals. This is my third one and the only weird thing is usually the next day my Urine can smell sweet. But isn‚Äôt that from ketones? Not sure. Outside of feeling extremely full, I feel fine lol.

I also get labs every 3 months. Last 3 re blood sugars

June 22 - FBG 75 - a1c 4.3

March 22 - FBG 77 - a1c 4.3

Dec 21 - FBG 81 - a1c 4.5

6194,What about fasting gets easier/better over time?,"For the past three years, I have been a 18:6 to 20:4 intermittent faster. Over the past few months, I have been adding in 40 hour fasts every other week or so. Here are some things that I have found that got easier and better over time: 

- The process as a whole gets easier. I feel like there is less hunger and less of the other fasting ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù (headaches, crankiness, etc).
- Sleep is better. And I don‚Äôt dream of Twizzlers anymore. üòÇ
- Breaking my fast isn‚Äôt an eating frenzy. My food intake has been moderated to the point that it almost feels like I am breaking a fast after any other day.

I broke the 300lb mark June 10th of this year and weighed in at 297. 

Having become comfortable with fasting and looking to also build more muscle while shedding more weight I transitioned to the 20:4 IF starting June 18th‚Ä¶ My first week the weight melted off, and I went from 296 to 285 through dieting and exercise. 

Now after my second week I‚Äôve noticed the weight creeping back. I know losing weight that exponentially isn‚Äôt normal and don‚Äôt expect to lose that much weight every week, but seeing it come back is just alarming after having come so far. 

My diet is the exact same, I‚Äôm not eating anything more or out of the norm of what i have been the last 3-4 months. My activity is still the same as it‚Äôs been yet I‚Äôm noticing myself gaining a half pound-pound day after day, which has crept me back up to 289/290.

Naturally I want to keep moving in the right direction, and stay on top of it. 

My diet consists pretty consistently of the same things‚Ä¶ Firstly, i ONLY drink water or Zero Calorie Sparkling Ice drinks‚Ä¶ (1 per day with dinner) I don‚Äôt drink any of my calories‚Ä¶ i eat Grilled Chicken/Pan seared chicken mixed in with onions and veggies, 9/10 times over/mixed in with some rice. Occasionally I‚Äôll switch it up and have some steak with mashed sweet potatoes (no sugars and honey and stuff with it) and veggies. I‚Äôve had a cheat day here and there throughout the process but it was all controlled and still in my calorie deficit. 

I know as i lose more weight, it‚Äôll require more exercise to continue to drop weight and that overall it will slow down.

However, the last couple days I've run into a problem with my cognition. My  brain is very slow. It takes me several attempts to read things. Conversations are hard, I'm not as witty.

My brain has all the symptoms of being exhausted, like I stayed up all night, except I don't feel tired at all.

I've had this in the past when I've tried intermittent fasting, and it's what made me quit as it got progressively worse. It seems to always happen when I hit a certain body fat percentage (not super low or anything, can't see abs yet).

It's been great the past month, so I don't want to give up!

Plan for this month is to keep it simple with a 16:8 while watching my calorie intake. May not always be able to count calories but ill be mindful of approximately how much I'm eating.

2. The principle of IF, from my knowledge, is that the fasting period will make your body use fat as energy. So how many meals are allowed in the ""eat"" period? Ofc I know that I can't binge on Fastfood and everything non-healthy during the eat period and expect this to work but how many regular meals can you have?  
3. Can you have cheat days? My work schedule is not that fixed so 2 days per week I can only do the 15-9 fasting type while the other 5 I can do the usual 16-8. Is it ok to just eat normally and not fast for those 2 days?

Data points 5 years ago from an old spreadsheet. 

Similarities:  
- IF 5x a week with 2 cheat days
- starting weight about the same
- only water during fasting period 

Changes
- I have added a green tea supplement 1x a day (I don‚Äôt drink green tea due to a mild allergic reaction) 
- determined that I‚Äôve had a zinc deficiency most of my life that my GP never caught, so I now take 15mg of zinc daily. 
-  I walk more now but run a lot less 
   (walk 0 mins then vs 1 hour daily now)         
   (ran 14-21 miles a week then vs 7 miles now)
-  sleep more now
-  100x less stress now.
-  diet is healthier as all meals are now home prepped vs eating my main meal out 5 years ago.  Better ingredients etc. 
-  16:8 or 18:6 then with 1st meal at noon.  18:6 or 20:4 now. Typically breaking fast at 9-11am after the morning walk/run. 
-  some light (body weight) core exercises 2x a week now.  
-  always hungry then and found it hard to make it to 18 hours. Now I realistically could probably do OMAD on most days and force myself to eat more on my non fasting days. My typical breakfast now is 2 pasture eggs, potatoes or 2 slices of bread and half to 1 slice of no nitrate bacon. That keeps me full till my last meal of the day. 

Results:
5 years+ ago - 47M/6‚Äô SW: 190lbs small frame (I‚Äôm skinny fat)
I lasted 8 weeks‚Ä¶ 2 lbs on the 1st week, then 0.5-1lb of loss typically for each week after. I found it too hard to sustain for the sacrifice vs reward.  I was always hungry. 

Now 53M/6‚Äô SW: 188lbs. 2 lbs for each for weeks 1-5. 0.5 lbs for week 6. 3 lbs for week 7. So it‚Äôs a lot quicker than expected. My Goal is for health / lose my belly fat before running more and eventually cutting back to alternating a non fast day with OMAD to maintain weight.

I am satisfied with my progress overall but one thing is really irking me. 

Double chin. 

I have zero to negligible face gain. 

Couple of points. My BMI was 25 when I started and now it's 21. 

I have lost inches on my wait and cheat, surely. My 30 waist jeans are fitting me again from 34 inches so that's great. My t-shirt size is back to medium from large. 

But the face still is the same. I still have double chin and drooping area under the jaw.

I‚Äôm concerned because he‚Äôs moving away from my parents soon, but clearly doesn‚Äôt mind his health very well (my parents do not try to overfeed him, although i think they did in his earlier childhood).

But before I bring it up, I wanna get a better idea of why he might be eating like this. For people with experiences of consistently overeating (like to the point where its not realistic that your body demands that many calories), what‚Äôs the reason? Is it a deeper emotional problem? Do you just genuinely feel hungry all the time? Did you have some kind of physical condition (eg thyroid or tapeworm)?

I am definitely in a calorie deficit status, but I don't understand why I am losing no weight at all. I burn an extra 400+ calories on the days I exercise as well. I am thinking of doing one meal a day or tryin to fast the whole day, but I work in an office and my stomach gets grumpy and noisy when I haven't eaten.

My goal is to burn as much weight as I can before Winter(November) as I am going to start bulking.

I started my weight loss journey in February, and was CICO only. 
I didn‚Äôt feel like I had enough structure, and was eating too frequently all day long. Late night cravings also got to me, and caused me to binge eat which threw me way off track. 

I adopted IF to provide that structure that I was lacking, and it has seriously boosted my weight loss more than I ever could have imagined.

So, I‚Äôd wake up around 8:30 AM. I‚Äôd have a big glass of lemon water and a 20oz black iced coffee.

Around 11:00am, I‚Äôd do a workout. Either at the gym, or a home workout. Both cardio and some strength training.

Then at around 12:30pm when my workout is over, I‚Äôll have a protein shake with almond milk and frozen berries.

I‚Äôll spend some time peeing out all that liquid and cooling off in the AC, and taking a shower.
Then around 2pm, I‚Äôll start making the biggest meal of my life.

Example meals: 1.5 cups of brown rice, 7oz of salmon, saut√©ed kale, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and roasted chickpeas with avocado on the side.
Then I‚Äôll maybe have a piece of chocolate or a protein bar as my treat right after dinner- it‚Äôs usually a small one because I can only fit so much inside of me.

Then for the rest of the day I‚Äôll have tea, black coffee and water until the next days 12:30pm protein shake.

So, I‚Äôd say maybe it‚Äôs OMAD, but it‚Äôs not, cause I have the shake which I think counts as a meal cause it‚Äôs milk and berries and protein?

6365,Advice from a veteran: dont go too restrictive !,"**englisch is not my native language, please be kind :-D**

&amp;#x200B;

this is just a advice from someone who did succesful omad for over 2 years now (60 pounds dropped and kept away), while watching many, many people fail.

if you do IF / omad or whatever, you already made a huge step in the right direction, but still there are ways to fail.

in the end its all cico - calories in/calories out if you are in a deficit you will lose weight, thats a fact, undenieable.. and thats the point there are two reasons you still can fail.

**reason 1: you overeat in your window of eating**    
self eplaining - if you inhalte a cheesecake and 5 bigmacs in half a hour it doesent matter if you fast the next 23hours, you still consumed 3 days worth of calories.

**reason 2 (and the most common): you dont eat enough**  
if you fast for 23hrs and your only meal contains like a 500calories salad because you want success super fast, you will fail. you cant live of so little food, at least not in the long run. + its unbelivable hard to fast without a ""reward"" at the end of the tunnel, you need huge  self discipline for that to work, and be honest, if you had the self discipline required you would not be in a ""obese"" body

find your maintenance calories - there are a lot of calculators online, then cut that down to 70-80% what should be your max. calories in your eating window.

for example: if your maintenance calories are 2000 eat 1400-1600 a day, you will have a deficit equal to losing a pound a week and thats super healthy because that way you never feel hungry, you have the chance of eating ""pleasure food"" that you enjoy and its better for the body to slowly burn what you slowly gained",intermittentfasting,1659691686

6396,I can really feel the 10 pounds now.,"I (M58) have been doing intermittent fasting for a couple of years, with occasional periods of unbridled eating. Usually, the eating corresponds to periods when I am nursing a sports injury (I try to stay active) and/or depressed (one contributes to the other).

I'm coming out of one of those periods at the moment, and, during that 3-month sojourn, I have put on 10 pounds. I am a cook and a baker, and I find joy in the kitchen. So, if I can't cycle, I comfort myself by cooking. Carbs are my kryptonite. And I make a mean sourdough.

The funny thing is, after having lost 40-50 lbs over the last 18 months, and regained 10, I can really *feel* it. I have gone from feeling ""fit"", to ""not fit"", and it has completely changed my body-psychology.

   
My health is still great. I do at least 5-6 hours of exercise each weak, and can still bike 50 miles.  
But I feel like I have to hide my belly, and it makes me self-conscious. 

I hope, this time, I can remember how good it feels to be fit, and how bad it feels to be unfit. It's kindof like getting a cold. You don't remember how icky it is until your have one, and all the symptoms that come with it. At that moment, you go, ""Oh yeah. *This* is why I hate getting a cold.""  

I'm taking off the weight, and it feels good. But, I'm also kicking myself for not making the necessary adjustments sooner.

Long time lurker in this community (I created a new account as my old one had the same username tied to my irl social media like Instagram and didn't want people searching my name to be able to find all my reddit stuff since I share more personal stuff on here as opposed to people I know IRL lol)

I first started IF in February of 2020 when I decided to buy the Delay Don't Deny book by Gin Stephens. Fast forward through the pandemic, I didn't gain any weight (yay!) but I didn't lose any either as I followed a (very) casual OMAD/Warrior schedule.  I decided back in June that I was going to start taking IF seriously and work on the food that I eat during my OMAD eating window. I was able to lose about 3-5 lbs in the first 2 weeks but the progress slowed significantly. After reading the stories of many wonderful people on this very thread, I realized that the 2 years of casual OMAD had essentially made my body adapt to OMAD :(  

Instead of letting that discourage me, I decided to try a modified ADF (OMAD on weekends) which eventually led me down the path of listening to The Fasting Method (TFM) podcast (also recommended by someone on this sub, thanks Sweatpant Diva!). TFM recommend 3 42 hour fasts a week, which fit my needs perfectly so I could still enjoy meals with my husband on weekends. It's been an amazing experience so far and for the first time in my life I find myself looking forward to weighing myself????

I wanted to say a huge thank you to this sub for the motivation and inspiration, without you I'd still be at my starting weight :(

6416,3 Month Check-in! 28.6 lbs down! 29/f SW: 185.4 CW: 156.8 GW: 154,"Hi everyone! 
My 3x42 hour fasts aka Alternate Day Fasting (ADF) has been continuing to go well. I had a slight hiccup this month when half way through I was developing symptoms that I thought were hypoglycemic but learned it was actually anemic symptoms. I took that week off to chill on my fasts and just did 20/4 while supplementing with iron and it helped immensely. I was right back on track after that week. 

This month was definitely slower weight loss for that minor pause but I‚Äôm so proud of myself for sticking with it üí™üèº

I am so motivated to reach my initial goal weight of 154 and I‚Äôm really close! At 154 I want to do a holding pattern and practice maintenance and then see if I‚Äôd like to lose any more. 

For those who may ask, I learned about the 3x42 ‚Äúgold standard for weight loss‚Äù from this podcasts [The Fasting Method Ep 5](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fasting-method-podcast/id1593883196?i=1000544199478). They are two incredible female doctors who work for Dr Jason Fung. I wanted to give their advice a shot since they are professionals and I had nothing to lose (but weight). It‚Äôs tough at first and took me about two weeks to dial it in but now I find it really easy to be honest. Weight is flying off by combining this fasting schedule with keto!

I do not count calories and I never will. My 3x42s looks like not eating Monday, Wednesday and Friday and on my eating days doing two meals no snacks within 4-6 hours. I‚Äôm not always the best at no snacks üôÉ

I‚Äôm 34 and somehow gained 30lbs from a really incredibly stressful year. I usually weigh 130-135 lbs, but now I weigh 165lbs, and my clothes are a biiiiiit tight. I do NOT want to buy new clothes, and I‚Äôm not happy with my inability to run and move like I used to. Like I can still do those things, but I used to be more agile and I used to be a little bit more flexible. Now I‚Äôve got some fat that gets in the way of being flexible. I‚Äôm just not enjoying all these little things that have changed. 

So! I‚Äôm doing intermittent fasting, OMAD, and am incorporating exercise 5-6 days a week. Might seem a bit intense to do all this at once, but I know from experience I need to go full-on, otherwise I will just easily slide back into old habits.

Have done all these things before, so it won‚Äôt be new, but man is my body out of shape (relative to what I‚Äôm used to).

Some considered that it's too early to talk about it's benefits since it's been one week only. They were partially right, because as it went on, I modified the hours.  Sometimes eating a little earlier, and other times eating a little later. I also had many cheat days (a bit too many). All in all in 3 months I lost 15 lbs, but missed my goal by 5 lbs.   
5 years ago I was easily able to lose \~8 lbs a month, hence why my goal was 220. Either my metabolism slowed down, or I really just had too many cheat days. I was also dealing with a coast to coast move, and I think I ignored my diet during that time.   
Nonetheless very happy with the results and I look forward to continue. I am hoping to cross below 200 lbs by September.

6427,How do you fit in protein in OMAD or 20:4?,"So IF has been working great for losing weight, but I'm having a hell of a time trying to fit 120g of protien into my window.  Most days I have sort of meal prepped, or at least know what I'm going to be eating, pre-log it in MFP even.  Usually supposed to be 2 meals and a shake or protien heavy snacks like beef jerky. Guaranteed after the first meal, I feel gross and full and don't want to eat whatever I planned so just chug a protein shake to bring me up to a minimum 85g of protein.

I've been trying to concentrate on weightlifting and trying to gain some muscle as well as fat loss. and I'm concerned I might start losing muscle from not enough protien/undereating.  Also, I've been training for a bike tour so 2hr+ rides and swimming masters 90min sessions so some days I burn quite a few calories.  I don't have a problem working out fasted or being hungry after, but I think I'll eventually burn out having extreme deficits.

I'm happy with the results. I used to count calories, which didn't work, and now with IF I eyeball my calories. I've been taking alot of vitamins and electrolytes to make sure I get all that I need daily. My questions are:

1. Is this doable long term to still get all nutrients and be healthy? I try to eat a salad or some vegetables when I eat my one meal at dinner but sometimes I eat junk.
2. How do you stop your stomach from growling? It doesn't happen often but I try to do TMAD if I have a meeting in the afternoon so I don't sound like a weirdo.

I have been doing 8:16 for about two months and have only lost 4lbs. I drink 3 liters of water in the morning before my window opens at 11 a.m., when I drink a cup of bone broth, and then at noon I start eating. I stop eating at 7 p.m.  My thought behind the bone broth is that it would help me ease into eating so that I'm not starving by the time I start at noon, but I don't think it works... I think my brain is so happy that I am ""allowed"" to eat, that any time during my feeding window when I see something I want to eat, I'm like, ""I can eat it because it's my feeding window!"" and then it backfires.

I‚Äôm new to this subreddit and haven‚Äôt even started IF yet. Had an interesting conversation with a patient of mine (I‚Äôm a physical therapist) about IF and the positive changes he had experienced from this. My patient is a very active and athletic person that does not ‚Äúneed‚Äù to lose any weight, but had noticed other positive changes such as being able to get off several medications that he had taken for years.

I, however, need to lose some weight and my blood pressure has been running a little high lately. I was thinking about IF as a potential solution to this, but I‚Äôm a ‚Äústress eater‚Äù and also tend to eat when I‚Äôm bored so it‚Äôll definitely be a big challenge for me. 

I am a very active person that enjoys lifting weights, running and playing soccer. I was wondering what everyone‚Äôs workout routine looks like?

6472,a nutritionist claims that intermittent fasting will slow your metabolism.,"[https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRU28kRJ/?k=1](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRU28kRJ/?k=1) 

In the video the nutritionist neglects to give us crucial information like the patient‚Äôs height, weight and fitness goals. It sounds like she was trying to lose weight because she was eating 1500 calories a day on 16:8 schedule (which is a deficit for most people) and working out 6 days a week for an hour a day while fasted. Didn‚Äôt say how intense or what kind of exercise. The nutritionist recommended the patient stop fasting and start eating 2300 calories a day to ‚Äúfuel her metabolism‚Äù. This nutritionist centers her content around breaking fad diet myths and telling people to eat more and more often.

In my experience while losing weight, I feel fine on roughly the same regimen as her patient. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 195lbs (looking to lose about 60lbs) at 29 years old. Now granted, I am obese so my body has plenty of fat to use as fuel. I eat around 1400-1600 calories a day and I walk 15,000 steps a day (about an hour and a half of low to moderate exercise per day) and regularly fast 18:6 and sometimes OMAD. I‚Äôve lost 20lbs and it‚Äôs the easiest weight loss I‚Äôve ever had. I feel like fasting, for me, is just a tool to help me control CICO. Because I have no self control when snacking. 

Idk it just makes me mad that people brush aside fasting without studying the benefits. I know this is anecdotal, but I have never felt better than when I started fasting. It just doesn‚Äôt seem like humans evolved to need to eat every 2-3 hours.

- face has a glow to it and is less puffy and bloated
- my stomach feels ‚Äòright‚Äô and not gassy and bloated at the end of the day
- mental clarity and MORE energy (HUH!?!?)
- improved mood

The only thing I‚Äôve encountered so far is that I am finding I need to be eating more calories (never thought I‚Äôd say that) because I‚Äôm generally not even super hungry when it comes to feeding time, and I get full quicker. This is seriously seriously magic.

I weighed in today and am up 5 lbs in the last two weeks.  My mental status has taken a huge turn for the worst in the last week, and depression has set in for the first time since starting IF - and it is hitting with a vengeance.

I had my first suicidal ideation in 6 months last night, and I'm very scared about the mental change that has taken place over the last 48 hours in my head.  I have always been addicted to food, and depression and anxiety have come with it.  Now that I'm physically better than I've been in a long time, here I am.

I am thinking that I didn't truly fix the mental issues I am having, only repressed them.  IF has been life changing for me, but I am still a fucking slave to that number on the scale.

Well, the rising cost of meat and food in general it‚Äôs getting hard to maintain Keto on a daily basis. 

Ive been thinking about eating on Saturday, Sunday and Monday (these are social days with the wife/fam so I wouldnt want to miss out on these). Then, I would fast Tuesday-Friday. 

Anyone else do 4 day fasts? Ive noticed my weight is starting to creep up a bit. I haven‚Äôt been eating the best in my 16:8 to be fair, so I know that doesn‚Äôt help.  

I‚Äôm wanting to lose a bit more weight and all in all feel better! When I was doing Keto/OMAD i felt really good and there were times I would go 3 days without eating cause I was so satiated.

[Meal plan with macro(2022)](https://imgur.com/a/vwJlf6E)  
Now I'm planning to start an easy-to-follow non-keto diet plan where my breakfast and last meal will be the same and only lunch will vary. From past experience, easy prep has worked well for me when I was doing keto. I also plan on doing IF(18:6) and proper gym this time.

I have a few questions I want your help with,  
Can you suggest a better macro ratio? Should I reduce my carb intake to get better results?  
Should I take any form of supplement?  
Is IF with high carb more difficult than IF with keto?

Also please let me if you see any other flaws in my plan. I'm mostly concerned doing deficit IF with such high carb will lead to hunger issues however my previous keto diet with the same deficit didn't cause any such issue. So I'm hoping this wouldn't either.

6559,Intermittent fasting turned ED? - MY STORY,"**Hey Everyone!** 

So, I've been debating wether to post my story here or not, but I feel reading someone else's experience when it comes to any situation helps others put into perspective the ""rights and wrongs"" of certain things, fasting/dieting being a huge question mark to many leaves endless possibilities in the many routes you can take to lose weight. 

My journey started March 2021, around the last two weeks of march I decided that I was going to start fasting. **I was 210lbs, 5'2 in height, 22 years old**, I was obese to say the least. But you know what's worse than being obese? Being obese and NOT recognizing it, I had developed many health issues due to my excess amount of weight but I refused to pin any of those health issues to my weight and tried finding any other reasons as to why I felt so bad. I had developed shortness of breath, taking 2 steps was like running a marathon, I started breaking out in random sweats and rapid heart beats at any moment throughout the day, I was 1 point away from being diabetic, I had developed high cholesterol, I took every medical test I could to try to rule out why my health was deteriorating so much. Finally taking the hardest step and accepting I was extremely overweight for my age and height, I took on fasting. 

While I was going into a diet plan I knew nothing about, I just started doing what I figured was ""fasting"" and started cutting my meals to One Meal a Day also known as (OMAD DIET), I ate everyday but only once around 5pm when I got home from work. 

Here was my eating schedule/menu from March 2021-July 2021:

&amp;#x200B;

* No food of any sorts from when I woke up till I was off work; kept myself full drinking water all day ONLY. Once I would get home from work I would eat lettuce, cucumbers, shredded carrots, avocado and a piece of grilled meat or grilled chicken (as lightly seasoned as possible), my salad without dressing only adding a squeezed lime to it for taste. I completely cut out any other form of food/nutrition. I started noticing I was losing weight but I didn't have a scale to actually see my progress, so I went to target and got myself a scale. to my surprise by this time, I was already down from 210lbs to 195lbs from March-June. Seeing the drop on the scale gave me this rush of dopamine (at least I think that's what I would feel every time I stepped on that scale and would see the number keep going down) and ultimately made me want to take my fasting routine to another level. Starting June 2021 I bought myself a used treadmill from Facebook marketplace and had my dad come with me to pick it up and in a few hours it was installed in my house and I was so hyped! I started working out, doing cardio only, walking on the treadmill for about 10 minutes only because I just couldn't hang any longer as much as I wanted too! I would immediately be out of breath! I felt like a fish gasping for air, my body was not in the slightest condition to take on not even the lightest workout, but I didn't give up and even if it was 10 minutes only, I would get on the treadmill everyday and do that 10 minute cardio. Gradually as the weeks went by my weight kept dropping, I started seeing that if I was losing about 1-2 pounds a day- yes; A DAY, that I could lose more if I upped my fasting method. So from eating one meal a day everyday, I started eating less and less. 

Starting August I began counting my calories excessively! (what calories?!, if I didn't eat shit!)

and my one meal a day became one meal a week or one meal every two days, meaning I wouldn't eat anything at all the other 5 days of the week, only water, strictly ONLY WATER. you couldn't get me to eat a cracker or a piece of candy, I was completely wrapped around fasting which little by little was becoming starvation due to my obsessive need to lose all the weight that was making me feel so shitty. I started telling my mom I would go out to eat with my friends so she wouldn't notice that I went a whole day without eating. I would simply go out, not eat anything at all, but come home letting her know I had dinner and it was delicious, to ease her mind and not make her eye my eating habits since they started becoming more and more extreme as the weeks went by. 

By this time frame (august 2021) I was at about 150lbs now, yup 50lbs down eating only lettuce with lime and tuna (un seasoned, undressed, just straight out the can onto a plate) and starving myself as much as I could. I had cut out any other forms of protein, on the day I did decide to have a meal it was always just that, tuna and lettuce. My workouts now were more intense and from only being able to do 10 minutes of cardio, I started doing 1 hour of HIIT cardio everyday, making sure I burned at least 800 calories or more solely through cardio, I was trying to burn off as much fat as I could before I started toning my muscles. I kept this up from August till present day (12/31/2021) it is currently still my daily workout routine. I make sure I don't miss a day, if I do, im flooded with guilt, feeling as if I was gaining back every pound I was losing by not working out or getting off routine. 

Now we are at October 2021, my birthday was on the 3rd. I turned 23 years old and I was weighing in at 125lbs now, I felt happy, I looked in the mirror and I was happy with what I saw reflecting back at me but this is where I started to realize, my fasting was really an ED I had developed. I realized this because despite dropping all the weight I had dropped in such a short period of time, I still felt as if it was not enough, instead of accepting my new weight loss, I beat myself up over it on a daily and made sure that even tho I was losing now about 2-3lbs a day, to not loosen up on my routine, I felt like one day of rest or one ""cheat day"" would set me back so far and make me gain the weight again, I was torturing myself at this point but I couldn't stop. I started doing the worse, I started taking laxatives and body detoxes thinking that whatever I DID eat, I didn't want it digested into my body. I would eat and about 30 minutes later would be downing a laxative or a detox shake to make me shit it all out and seeing that the next morning I had lost another pound or two when I stepped on the scale just encouraged me to not stop drinking laxatives as well.

Currently it is the last day of December 2021, and I weigh 107lbs. I see myself and I know I am more than fine physically, health wise its like I never had high cholesterol or was pre diabetic, I feel great in that sense. but mentally I feel like I abused the term ""fasting"" and went my own unhealthy route to get the results I wanted, but in all honesty I didn't have a certain goal, I didn't have a set weight or number I was aiming for, I was just trying to not be OBESED at 22 years old. 

So my eating habits now look a little like this :

&amp;#x200B;

* One meal a day, consists of Rice, and salmon about 700 calories (if I do eat this meal I make sure to burn the same number of calories that I ate kind of making my caloric intake a 0)
* Water only as my beverage of choice at all times 
* no sweets, sugars, processed foods, chips, red meat or chicken
* no caffeine, no energy drinks (I used to love redbulls!), no Starbucks, no dunkin donuts
* I stay under 800 calories a day, and whatever calories I do eat, I burn them working out later that day.
* Currently still trying to get off the laxative habit and let the food I do eat, nourish my body.

I know the habits I have developed are not healthy to say the least and I do not recommend for you to go about losing weight in such an unhealthy way. Currently now, I am struggling with my relationship with food and eating and with the acceptance that I do deserve to have a meal I like or an ice cream or a cup of juice, I have accepted that I fall under the ED spectrum and wanted to tell my story so others can see that you can get lost if you obsess over anything really and hopefully you take the wrongs I made with my weightloss journey and go about it in a much more healthier way. I lost 100lbs in about 9 months and I don't know when im going to get back into a normal eating routine but its something in the front of my mind that I slowly am working on.

I had weight gain from wife's third pregnancy because if she was going to enjoy her last one so was i. The problem was that I Rollercoastered even higher. I never thought I'd break 200 I never thought I'd go even higher than that. I never ever thought i would legit be mistaken for my dad when he eating ice cream out of the carton every night. Work was stressful, baby and kids were stressful, it was rough.

I stop around  8pm and eat after 1230. I no longer have to track and micro manage my intake. It just feels relaxed and every week I lose about a half to a full pound. If I slip up it doesn't feel that a complete failure. I eat healthier by default. I eat regular portions and snacks. I exercise just by having kids. Wife is giving more compliments.

So Ive been fasting for a few years, and for the last 2 years have stuck to a 4 hour eating window at night. I love it so much as it has given me super even energy throughout the day and the best sleep of my life! 

Unfortunately, I stopped menstruating and based on what I‚Äôve read, it could be because my eating window is too small. I also read studies showing that opting for an 8 hour window is better for weight and overall health. 

So for the past two weeks I‚Äôve added a small meal at lunch (a protein shake) and I hate it lol. My digestion feels terrible, my energy levels are all over the place, and I get really hungry at random times. It also just takes up too much time that uses to be free for other things. 

Long story short I miss my 4 hour window. Should I just ride this adjustment out? Does anyone know if going back to a 4 hour window is definitely bad for women? Maybe my my menstruation is due to something else?

6588,2 Months In &amp; New Resolutions,"Hello everyone! I \[34/F\] want to write a status update on myself including what has worked for me so far and what I plan to do in the new year. 

So far I've been doing IF for 2 months. When I began I basically couldn't live without my coffee and cream so I decided to break my fast upon waking up and then switching to a fasted state after lunch. I  did this for a couple weeks until I finally decided to stop my sugary creamer and go black coffee. The last month and a half I've been doing OMAD. My diet hasn't really changed other than I refuse to drink my calories (no soda, milkshakes, etc), I'm trying to limit the days when I eat added sugar (1-2 days a week only), and I'm trying to increase my fiber intake. 

Month 1 I refused to weigh myself. I didn't want to. I didn't want to be discouraged by seeing the scale to up and down or do the math of how much I'll have to lose in order to feel like I hit my goal. I am too type A to know I hyper fixate so I just did IF and just listened to my body. I could feel myself physically feel better. Month 2 I decided to weigh myself and stepped on a digital scale that updates on my app every morning (ritualistically wake - pee - strip - weigh). My days were variable where I went up quite a few days but would always come back down. Middle of the month out of nowhere I could feel myself get bloated for 3 days then it disappeared and this last week I've been dealing with being a tad sick which has also kept my weight up/down. 

Here is a one month daily weigh in chart. I removed the weight reading and just wanted to focus on the direction my weight is going. I'm definitely losing and losing in the guidelines that people consider healthy:  [https://imgur.com/a/jlebAXa](https://imgur.com/a/jlebAXa) 

I'm not big on new years resolutions but decided to push myself to continue a few things:

1. **Weigh myself every day** as I have been doing. I know this is something that other's will find very troubling but for me I am OK with the days that I increase as long as I am not consistently increasing. I want to be accountable first thing in the morning to know this number. 
2. **Do IF every day.** I'm not even concerned if it's OMAD every day. I just want to be able to say each day that there is a set time when I am going to be fasting. If it's for 23 hours or for 16 I don't really think it matters. What matters is that I am being intentional with it. 
3. **Continue to focus on reducing added sugars in my diet** to only 1-2 days a week. I live in America where we consume processed foods like crazy but I physically feel better not eating sugar every day. The first couple weeks was rough but after that I feel like even caffeine is optional to me. (I used to be a Starbucks drive thru person every day on the way to the office)

I have other goals that I'm making for my physical health and bucket list goals but I think these three things are absolutely doable, will not make me feel burnt out by February, and I know will make me feel good by the end of 2022. 

I'm curious if anyone else has similar goals and how are you going to track them. I'll also recommend the book Atomic Habits for those really wanting to make clear, actionable goals.

6601,32F / 5'3 / CW: 189 / GW: 135. Hi! I'm a first time mom to a baby that will be 1 year in a couple weeks. Ready to get my pre-quarantine and pre-baby body back. First time intermittent fasting. I want to get down to GW in 6 months. Think 16:8 would work? Any advice?,"TLDR: I'm 32, 189lbs, 5'3. Had a baby a year ago and WFH. I need to get control back of my body. I've never done IF, but think it's a great option for me. I was thinking 16:8, 10am-6pm meal window would be best. My birthday is in 6 months and I'd love to be at pre baby weight (156), if not GW (135) by then. Thoughts? Advice? 

I've always struggled with my weight, and it seems to fluctuate with my mental health. The highest I've ever been before 2021 was 179, and that was for about 3 months. My average weight has been about 140 in the past 7 years, with my lowest being 127.  

At the beginning of 2020 I was 145lbs (10lbs away from my goal weight). Then quarantine hit, and like a lot of people, I gained weight. So when I got pregnant, I was 156lbs. During the pregnancy I packed on the pounds, hit 199lbs, but had a big baby, so dropped to 172lbs in 6 weeks. Breastfeeding made me so hungry and I developed horrible eating habits, which resulted in me gaining 17lbs back. Now I'm at a staggering 189lbs and feel totally out of control. I've read up on IF and I think it'll be a good way to get that control back. 

I think I'm going to try 16:8, with the window being from 10am-6pm. My birthday is in 6 months so I want to reach prebaby weight (156) by then, or even GW (135).

6654,How can I learn to fast?,"Hi. I'm 32, female, 5'6"", and my weight fluctuates around 190-196lbs. I was 135 for most of my adult life. Then my doctor put me on a medication with weight gain as a side effect. At the same time my then husband left me and eating sweets was my only comfort. One the past 4 years I've been trying to lose weight, but barely getting anywhere. 

My mom recommended IF to me and explained the benefits and how it works, but every time I try I can I start to get extremely hungry and then cave. I think one of my biggest problems is that I tend to get hungry before bed (or wake up in the middle of the night) and can't fall asleep until I eat something. 

Another thing that I think makes it difficult for me is that  I usually don't get very hungry during the day. I've never had a big appetite, so I've always had a habit of eating slowly over the course of a day and it's very hard for me to not do that.

So last time round I managed to loose about 2 stone and was really happy with the results and I was managing the OMAD really well, now the annoying thing is now is my potential eating window. Before I used to eat between 3-4pm and that worked for me but now I have taken on a new job where that may not be possible. On some days I wont be able to eat until between 6-8, so really the question is, will it have a negative impact if I move my eating window by a few hours from day to day?

6661,A quick thanks to this community,"April 1st of this year I made a decision to drop the weight. I had lurked on this sub for awhile prior to that and thought about it from time to time, but never actually pulled the trigger. 

On Feb 28th I went in for my routine physical, which of course requires a weigh in. I didn't think going in that it was that bad, outside of seeing pictures of myself from time to time and just thinking, that can't be right (camera adds 10lbs, shitty angles, etc). Their scale said 247lbs, I was absolutely livid with myself. I couldn't believe that I had actually let myself get to that point (41M 5'10 btw), and I spent the next 8 hours at work just absolutely angry and depressed. 

I made a conscious decision that day that I was bound and determined to do something about it, and I'm happy to report that since Apr 1st, I've gone from 247lbs down to (at my lowest) 192lbs with the help of this community. 

This isn't meant to be a brag post or anything like that, it's actually a heart felt thank you to this community and its members who offer advice, post pics, and stay in the fight right along with everyone else. I've learned several things about IF, and about myself along the way.

I started at about 188 but that was actually water weight, and within a week i lost the water weight and was at 183 lbs which i was happy about. I got the nexplanon implant about 4 months ago, i was alittle nervous because I‚Äôve heard of women experiencing weight gain, BUT I used in the past and didn‚Äôt experience any weight gain. This time around though I noticed alot of bloating as well as the usual symptoms of low sex drive, and some vaginal dryness, irregular periods that lasted about the first 2 months then those symptoms subsided. So here‚Äôs the thing, my weight stays at 183 lb no decrease at all, it worries me because in the past when I did IF (fast for about 17-21 hr a day depending) i was able to melt weight right off, like i could lose 15 lbs in 2 weeks with little to no physical activity. NOW I go to the gym regularly do most medium cardio 40 minimum about 4-5 days a week and fast eating clean (some splurge days) but usually eat clean with cleaner complex carbs but my weight week and week stays at 183lb.

6679,Lost my OMAD momentum - any tips,"TL:DR - lost momentum on OMAD (after 1.5 years and weight loss), keep struggling but trying to return, and wanting pointers / advice

I was on OMAD from March 2020, until September 2021, and i lost circa 12 kgs.  I had a winter 2MAD for 3 months during that period which slowed things.

Since September, i have had a few things happen which have resulted in meal times being screwed, i slipped into 2MAD in October, and in November briefly got back to OMAD and then now back at 3 times a day.  Weight has gone up as a result.

my main is lunch during OMAD, and i find it easy to cut breakfast usually.  However as i keep trying to get back to OMAD, i keep eating high calorie lunches, and then falling for dinner (with  breakfast most days at moment)

6685,After Year Of Intermitent Fasting...My Tips,"So I've been doing IF probably 10 yrs ago when Lean Gains stuff came out but after becoming a father and a busy family man...I fell off the wagon. Year ago I decided it was enough and I went back to gym and IF lifestyle, went from 120kg to 86kg as of today. Here  are some tips and things that I experienced through my journey

‚Ä¢ CICO is real, you have to watch your intake and people like me who can eat enormous amounts of of food especially need to track stuff. Some people can't ingest a lot of calories in a short time window...I can. I will smash a whole bread if it's coming hot from oven :)

‚Ä¢ Scale is not to be trusted short term, watch your waist measurements and how you look rather than digital scale every morning. I had literally been stuck at 92.15kg for 2 weeks...every single day same weight. I thought scale has gone mad, checked it with a dumbell...guess what, it was dead on. My body was maintaining weight to the 0.1kg tolerance for freaking two weeks...and then it all flushed away after two weeks.

‚Ä¢ Keto works...it really does. I believe there is no better combination for weight loss than IF+Keto. But it's not for everyone, it is incredibly strict and antisocial way of living. Having to worry about being under certain carb amount the whole day is very stressful, at least for me. I do lower carb diet but not strict Keto as I just cannot sustain the rigorous regime of the whole thing. Also I do better in gym when having some carbs pre workout...follow your body. 

‚Ä¢ If you slip and binge eat one day...no drama. Eat nothing for 24h and continue the usual regime. I even lost weight after these binge days...you know social events, friend and family gatherings. Overshooting calories may seem like a disaster but in long term it is just a blip on the chart, absolutely unimportant and  not to be stressee about. Do not be put off by this, continue the plan as if nothing happened and do not let this derail your long term goals.

‚Ä¢ Ignore people freaking out when you explain how you don't eat for most of the day. Remember you are the one feeling amazing now and more energetic than ever.",intermittentfasting,1640772703
6686,"It‚Äôs probably been talked about before, but can someone talk to me about no calorie sweetener?","I find 16:8 to be actually really easy except for my morning coffee. I absolutely need coffee to function and I hate it black. So on fasting days I put in a few no calorie sweeteners. 

I‚Äôm new to fasting but I‚Äôve heard this is really controversial. Has anyone had success while using sweeteners? I don‚Äôt need to lose a ton of weight, I‚Äôm doing it more to get in control of my eating, for mental health, and to cut a few calories out of my day.

Also: if you‚Äôre a ‚Äúclean fast‚Äù kind of person, does that mean you don‚Äôt brush your teeth or use mouthwash in the fasting window?",intermittentfasting,1640764225

I started IF just a few days ago and i've started with the 16:8 pattern. My fasting times were scheduled 2pm-6am. I'd usually break the fast by 6:30 with a bowl of sugar free muesli. I saw a Dr. Berg video where he suggested to wait atleast for 4 hours after waking up to break the fast. Is this necessary? Is it important?,intermittentfasting,1640758607
6692,Is 14:10 worth it as a starting point?,The lowest amount I‚Äôve seen mentioned on here (I‚Äôm new as of today) is 16:8. However I just downloaded a tracking app and it recommended starting at 14:10. I‚Äôm M 5‚Äô9 167 with and goal of 150.

6694,"If you get an insulin spike, can that drop you out of ketosis?","This question is in relation to diet soda on fast. Some people claim that this and any sweetener can cause an insulin spike. I‚Äôve succeed in losing 18kg with IF (OMAD) and keto diet but during my fasts I drank a lot of Coke Zero. 

But, I want to know the actual impact of getting an insulin spike if it does happen, should I be getting kicked out of ketosis? 

What about the other impacts? What about around building insulin resistance? I‚Äôm a pre diabetic and would like to use IF as a way to build insulin resistance. 

Could there also be grades of insulin spikes? So even if diet soda does spike insulin, could it be short lived and still the overall contribution to insulin resistance is positive?

6702,So‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ what do I try next?,"I‚Äôve been doing IF for about six months.  Usually 18:6 but sometimes 20:4.  Eat whole foods the rest of the time, nothing processed, mostly grain and dairy free, always sugar free.  Earlier this year it was determined by a nutritionist that I should be aiming for 1200-1400 calories a day so I‚Äôm usually in that range.  I went a bit above it in case I was restricting too much, nothing happened.  I went a bit below, nothing happened.  Light exercise; I can‚Äôt do any cardio otherwise my autoimmune issues flare up, but I walk a lot, do yoga and a bit of weights.  I get as much sleep as I can manage, my blood labs are in range.

6704,"IF works! If I can do it, you can too!","I started this journey in August of 2021.  At the time, my weight was somewhere in the 170 lb range for my 5‚Äô3‚Äù height.  I quit weighing once I saw the scales hit and try to recalculate when I was 170.  It most likely was more but I was too embarrassed to see the real weight.  I was so despondent and angry that I let myself get to this point and trying to tell myself that bigger and fluffier was ok, as in body acceptance and positivity.   


In truth, I was a miserable soul.  I did not know where to start, but I knew I did not want to land in my PCP office or the ER with notes of‚Ä¶.‚Äù63-year-old obese female ‚Ä¶..‚Äù. I looked back on vacation pictures where I was completely out of shape, just taking up so much space, unable to walk or exercise so I just sat (A LOT) and ate my way through the fat depression and pandemic and used any excuse I could find for not losing weight and trying to validate my obesity.  

So, I started a limited version of IF, not removing the offensive foods (sooooooo many carbs / snacks) and saw a small but significant weight loss.  That small change made all the difference in the world in how I found the motivation to keep it going and moving my personal  goal posts along the way.  When I started logging every single thing I ate during my open eating window, I realized I could do so much more, not be hungry and still have weight loss.    


Long story short, I used the 16:8 window, logged every food (using the LoseIt app), walked a dedicated 10,000 (plus) steps per day, and found I was much happier, more energized and ‚Äúfull‚Äù even though I was taking in fewer foods and calories.  Once in a while I did the OMAD plan, other days I did 18:6 plan, or the 20:4 plan.  I changed it up constantly but never went over 1,200 calories and still felt satisfied.    


Today I am at my goal weight of 125 however I think I would be happier with 120  or even 115 if my body would ever get over this plateau.  I still eat and drink many things that are in the comfort food list, but I have them in moderation.  I absolutely hate exercise but found that even mild walking (while listening to audible books or podcasts) helped me to keep moving.  I have a history of not one but two previously broken knees, surgically repaired ‚Äî which made walking difficult initially but as the weight loss continued, I was able to walk even more.  Again, no matter what your situation, it is not only possible but probable success  if you just give it an honest try.

I think the lack of carbs is not allowing my brain to produce sufficient serotonin. So I have a hard time falling asleep. And staying asleep. 

The way to counter this is to rely on OTC sleep meds such as benadryl. Or to eat many carbs during my one meal.

6727,Lady period problems and IF,"Hi everyone, newbie to IF, and just getting my first period after being on this 16:8/20:4 protocol for 3 weeks.

Btw, I'm 36 years old, popped out 3 babies, 5'4"", SW: 225 lbs, CW: 205 lbs, GW: whatever weight will allow me to do 3 unassisted pull ups.


Today is day 1 of shark week, and I'm RAVENOUS, crampy, moody, headachey, and craving all the carbs/dairy/chocolate.  I'm going to break my fast (and my streak, sad face,) but want to hear from other women (or men whose family) also pause their IF routine during Aunt Flo, and if so, for how long, what they do, etc.

I looked at the posts in the past, and it looks like a hodgepodge of people not breaking their IF, sticking to 16:8 (not happening today, hah), or just having... Way more self control than I clearly have.

6728,Thoughts/experiences of OMAD for weight loss over time?,"So I've even listening to Megan Ramos' new podcast (highly recommend) and she says that OMAD isn't great for consistent weight loss because the body is very adaptable and after a while it adapts to only eating one meal a day, so weight loss slumps. Her recommended eating pattern is two 42 hour fasts and three 24 hour fasts per week to switch things up regularly. Obviously that's much more significant fasting and would be a lot harder to achieve, but it probably would lead to much more significant weight loss.

So what happens when goal weight is reached? Do you always have to eat OMAD and employ longer fasts? Or just go back to a 16:8 routine and the weight stays off? Is resting metabolic rate lowered to the point of not being able to eat ‚Äúnormally‚Äù without gaining all the weight back?

- Therefore, say your basal metabolic rate is 1880 calories per day. There is no real advantage to reducing your calories to 1500/day with fasting, unless you want that to become your new basal metabolic rate over time(?). For example, there‚Äôs that famous study of runners in a tribe who burn only 1,200 calories a day because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre used to eating.

Before IF, I was drinking 2-4 high ABV beers or cocktails per weekday. Weekends started with a Bloody Mary, ended with an Old Fashioned, and had a lot of booze and tv in between. 

I felt like I was in this terrible never ending loop of work, eat, drink, sleep, repeat. 

As my fasting period started creeping up, I naturally started drinking less. I‚Äôve had a single beer in the last week, and turned down several drinks in process. Before IF, I don‚Äôt think I ever turned down a drink. 

 I‚Äôve been eager to get through my last meal for the day to trigger the fasting timer. In the morning and afternoon, I find I‚Äôm generally not even hungry now. All the breakfast junk food and sweet treats I used to eat are now off the menu. 

The crazy thing is, I don‚Äôt miss any of the food or drink that I had become so conditioned to. 

I also have a ton of energy now. Like crazy, stupid get off my ass and do a bunch of shit energy all the time. I‚Äôm getting a ton done around the house, and I‚Äôm exercising regularly. I‚Äôve picked up hiking and did a 6 hour 14 mile hike today. That would have never happened previously.

6807,Shifting hours and flexibility of IF,"I tried IF last year by skipping dinner. But my family always eats and became impossible to avoid eating. I'm from South America, and here dinner is usually after 9PM, in my home we usually ate dinner around 10 PM or so.

I wanna give it a go again. My idea is eating my last meal (dinner) around 10 PM or so. And eating lunch at 2 PM (this is basically my schedule tho).

But here's the thing, I've read so many mixed opinions on what meal to skip, etc. I'm just wanna have some input on that kind of schedule.

Also, the other question is about flexibility. If some night my dinner is delayed and I eat at, idk, 11 PM. Does just doing the 14 hours of fasting window works even if you delay it an hour?

6814,Digging deep: What about your childhood or adult life made food/self-discipline so hard?,"I thought this could be an interesting exercise/discussion for all of us. I‚Äôm very curious to hear what you all have to say.

I‚Äôm wondering, for those of you who feel you have lacked self-discipline in the past and/or issues with food: *What about your childhood or adult life has led to this? And what sort of self-reflection or conclusions have you come across that has helped you fast?*

* This is not to pass all blame to parents, but I recently came across a passage somewhere that said people with abusive or neglecting parents often spend all their energy as kids walking on egg shells and catering to their parents‚Äô feelings, so by the time they‚Äôre adults, they haven‚Äôt learned how to deal with their own emotions and self-soothe with food, drugs, etc. I personally thought that theory was pretty profound.

* I live alone with no family in a foreign country, and I definitely have noticed in five days of fasting that I feel the urge to eat when I am bored, lonely or don‚Äôt know what to do. It made me realize I used to make an ‚Äúevent‚Äù out of eating to fill my day. My mother would also do this‚Äî a mealtime was the only time I ever got any semblance of her attention. In other words, as an adult, I used food to self-soothe but also to make sure my day on paper had some sort of ‚Äúpeak.‚Äù

* I have so much self-discipline when it comes to work or virtually all other habits, even exercise. I have a do-or-die, success-driven or even unhealthy work ethic for most things. But the habit of overeating has eluded me. I still haven‚Äôt unpacked what that‚Äôs about but just wanted to share.

6821,Question about my IF schedule,"I'm brand new to IF. I decided to flip the switch from eating junk food every day to getting meal plans sent to my door weekly. I am pairing that with intermittent fasting.

Each meal is between 500-650 calories. I wake up around 11:30 am. I eat a meal right away, and about 2-3 hours later I eat another. Then I fast until the next morning. Ocassionally I eat an apple or banana to add onto that (within the fasting hours). I also want to eventually throw in some protein drinks into the mix. But as of now, that is what im doing.

My question is, is my window of eating bad? I typically see people on here completely skipping breakfast and eating later in the day instead. I am the total opposite, and I'm wondering if that has any negative side effects. I like to eat in that 2-4 hour window so that food is not a distraction from my work or other activities.

Now my workout time varies depending on my schedule, so sometimes I workout when I‚Äôm still in my fasting window.
Now my question is, after a workout if I still haven‚Äôt reached my eating window, should I break my fast with a protein shake to ensure my muscle get the protein they need after a workout? Or does that that not matter and I should just continue not having any calories until my fast is over?

As this got easier I started to not want the aspartame and carbonation of the diet ginger ale so I switched to hot tea which isn't the only thing that helps me. Something that helps with my appetite when it becomes physically distracting is Psyllium husk. I put about a table spoon into a bottle a water and CHUG!

6851,Questions on eating window on 16/8 IF plus exercise,"Quick facts:Age: 42, Male, 190 lbs (86 kgs). I lifted weights on and off for years (due to family), I've been working out steadily for 5 months and planning to continue. I try to lift 5 times a week, with a PPL routine. I successfully did OMAD for a year a couple of years back and it worked out for me.

I had a lifestyle change recently which means I can cook at night for myself now, and I decided to go on IF again, but while trying to maintain and maybe even adding muscle if at all possible.

I read that the best IF method for muscle maintenance is 16/8. I read an article from 2016 (Journal of Translational Medicine) which supported what I read online. So I will be going on a 16/8. Here are my questions:

1. I didn't diet for the first 5 months of strength training, and I'm going to start the IF to cut for a few months before getting off it. Am I wrong to assume I can cut via IF?
2. My workout hours are 7:30PM - 8:45PM. Which means that by the time I get home and cook, I will be eating until 10PM or so, considering delays. How bad is this delayed window, because I also read that *fat loss is best if you stop eating as early as possible*? I go to bed at 11PM and sleep around midnight (reading, not twitter). Should I rush to finish eating earlier, or am I worrying too much over the late meal?  I can prepare my dinner in advance, but I'd rather do it fresh because my fast-breaking meal will also be prepped to eat at work.
3. To avoid the late-ending meal, should close my eating window *before* working out? I would hate to work out and wait hours before eating.
4. Let's talk supplements. I take multivitamins and fish oil (since until now I can't choose my meals, and I can't eat seafood). I use protein powder and creatine, with carnitine in the morning. Since I will eat at 2PM, some snacks (or another meal) later and last meal ending at 10PM, should I just do the protein powder+creatine ""half-before, half-after workout"" as usual? Or with IF, would something else work better?
5. I also plan to do cardio in the mornings. I've always had terrible aerobic capacity because of childhood (cured since) asthma, and having covid late-2020 wrecked my lungs even worse. I will follow a modified version of the C25K and build up my capacity somehow. My question is, the possible cardio time will be 6:15AM-7AM-ish. Right in the middle of the fasting window. Is this doable? I mean maybe I start fasting first so that my stomach stops growling after a couple of weeks, AND THEN start the cardio?

My boss will offer to buy the other coaches dinner some days and last night we went to Italian food and I ate a ton of bread with olive oil and got lasagna because that‚Äôs my favorite. I knew I needed more protein when I got home and it was too late to make chicken before bed so I had whey instead. I normally don‚Äôt eat white bread because i have slightly high blood pressure and try to stick to high glycemic foods. But when I eat out I typically don‚Äôt worry about nutrition as much because I am very strict the rest of the time.

I take fish oil with dinner and I‚Äôm taking magnesium glycinate before bed plus Calm (magnesium threonate) in the morning. I normally take caffeine in the morning in the form of preworkout powder, but this morning I took a bioLit nootropic supplement with caffeine in it and I think it may have upset my stomach or added to blood sugar problems. 

Yesterday morning I woke up early to play volleyball and sauna before starting school work. Today I‚Äôve decided to rest instead of lifting weights like I normally would on a non volleyball day because I really don‚Äôt feel good.

I‚Äôm debating whether the main cause of my nausea and low energy is the nootropic pill, the high carb/low protein/high sodium dinner (or maybe I don‚Äôt have enough sodium due to fasting and yesterdays exercise), or I just need to get through the 2 week period to adjust to fasting again.

Hoping for just general recommendations from anyone who works out often in the mornings and eats later, and or anyone who has high blood pressure, do you take sodium during fast or are you very careful to not consume too much sodium during eating window? Do you find it is super important to not have too much simple carbs when fasting? Does anyone else take some form of caffeine supplement in the morning or is black coffee the best?

Since I eat mostly Keto (and my A1c is 5.32) my guess is that eating whenever I want on my ADF day.. is  causing my insulin to raise and that is how I am gaining weight.

Some info: 23F, 172 cm or 5‚Äô7.7, CW: 60 kg / 132.27 lbs, GW: 55 kg / 121.25 lbs

Fasting period: 22h00 - 19h00 (mostly sedentary)

Between 19h and 22h I would eat the following meals:
-oatmeal with feta cheese and tomatoes
-salad
-chicken
-as well as anything my mom makes lol
-tons of water and no alcohol/smoking/coffee/tea
I don‚Äôt track my calorie count, but I‚Äôd estimate it to be around 1600 kcal in total.

Outside of my fasting period, my diet is the exact same, but set in normal time frames.

Goal: I‚Äôm hoping to reach and maintain a weight of 55 kg. The past 5 years, my weight and height haven‚Äôt fluctuated (HW being 62 kg). I‚Äôve had a consistent diet with no exercise involved and no extremities like starvation. Is my body just too stubborn to lose the extra 5 kg?",intermittentfasting,1662125572
6893,exercise while fasting,"I'm going to start IF again (after 2 yrs of not doing it anymore, damn pandemic and work stress.) I used to exercise in the afternoon around 12p then break my fast at 1pm. It was easy.  Now, 2 yrs later,  I left my high stress job and started new job,  but only time i have to exercise is 5am. I used to drink black coffee to wake me up, but it doesn't do the trick anymore.  I discovered C-4 pre-workout and it is helping to give me that boost I need.  But now that I've decided to go back to IF, will the pre workout hinder my IF results??",intermittentfasting,1662118430
6894,New to IF - Is this a pragmatic schedule?,"Hey everyone!

It's my first time posting here, so apologies for my newbie question.

I am hoping to re-start working out after a 2.5 year break and I am looking at combining it with IF (16:8).

**About me:** 31, male, 5'9 (175cm), 194lb (88kg), \~30% body fat. Hoping to lose fat and maintain/build muscle.

**Scheduling factors to consider:** I work from 0900-1500 with a one hour break in the middle. I am an evening person, so want to hit the gym, fasted after work. There's no way I'd be able to workout at 0700. Bedtime is usually 0030/0100.

&amp;#x200B;

**Proposed schedule**

**Fasting period:** 0100 *(realistically will be a little earlier)* \- 1700, fuelled by water/black coffee/tea.

**Workout time:** 1530 - 1700

**Eating window:** 1700 - 0100

\- Break fast with a protein shake @ 1700

\- Snack (nuts?) @ 1800

\- Main meal @ 1930

\- Evening meal (porridge + banana) @ 2300

\- Sleep @ 0030/0100

&amp;#x200B;

Do more experienced fasters have any thoughts/suggestions to alter the above?

Thanks in advance :)",intermittentfasting,1662117284

I have a very strong stomach, I can eat almost anything without throwing up or being stomach sick, so yesterday when I spent 30 min throwing my guts out after eating fried things made me wonder... Since I had eaten that before without being sick, my body changed the way it reacts to fat?

I started intermittent fasting in May as an experiment. Lost 10lbs. Got very lean. Discovered that I could run faster for longer = result! But also realised that my prime motivation for running (thinking I was keeping my weight down) may have been a little misguided. My mileage hasn't really changed since I started IF - it's clearly the diet clean up that's having the effect on my weight.

So how do I motivate myself to put on my shoes when I can see that running makes little difference to my weight! And of course running stimulates the appetite so I'll probably put the 10lb back on! Aggh

I'm a 24 male who currently weight 207lb and I'm losing 1lb a week. I'm practicing IF for like a month right now.

I have a question, right now I'm doing 16/8 IF but the eating gap can variate because of my work. Currently I have 3 different hour ships, for example: On Monday I work from 12am to 20pm, on Tuesday I work from 13pm to 21pm, on Saturday and Sunday I work from 10am to 18pm.

And I always have dinner with my family, so sometimes I have dinner at 9pm and sometimes like 11pm. Beside all of that,no matter the time I finished my last meal I always do my 16hs of fasting.

So my question is, it's really important to have a good eating gap ? Or it's still most important have the 16hs fasting to still having all the benefits?.

Anyways, I‚Äôm getting a rash again already. Based on research and personal experience, the rash seems to be caused by a skin reaction to acetone from being in ketosis. And/or some kind of candida die off related issue. 

My question is for people who persisted with IF or keto with the rash and found that it eventually went away after your body became more acclimated. How long did it take?

6975,I increased my daily fasting window by 5 minutes per week for 2 years - now I'm doing 22:2!,"Hey everyone! I'm up to 22:2 and here with another update. 

[Update 1 (16:8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/l1kcdn/baby_steps_leading_to_bigger_success/)  
[Update 2 (18:6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/ore48u/ive_now_been_increasing_my_fasting_window_for_60/)  
[Update 3 (20:4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/smrot2/ive_increased_my_daily_fasting_window_by_5/)

Previous updates TLDR: Starting weight: 190, current weight: 160. I started with baby fasts and bumped it up by 5 minutes every week. 16:8 was too intimidating when I started, but 12 hour fasts seemed more doable. Eventually, as I learned to accept my hunger and just let it pass, the longer fasts became physiologically and mentally easier than the shorter fasts I did early on. Little wins have built on each other to create ""success momentum."" My biggest challenges have been social activities and exercising towards the end of a long fast, resulting in more frequent ""cheats"" as the fasting lengths have increased. Even when I'm short of my goal, I still usually end up with something like a 17 hour fast which itself is a success. 

I definitely did not think I would ever make it to regular, 22 hour fasts, but here I am doing it 5 or 6 days a week without much trouble. I've noticed that time of day is much more predictive of how hard a fast will be rather than the length of the fast. I've been fasting from 7pm to 5pm the next day, but if I try to do 8pm to 6pm, that is so much harder. 

I've also started losing weight again, whereas I kind of stalled for a long time on either side of 18:6. I actually think I'm getting quite close to my ideal weight, so I think I will finally bring my little experiment to an end and see if I hit a equilibrium after a few weeks/months of 22:2. Extended fasts are definitely on the menu for future experimentation though!

Two years is a long time do be doing something, so it's kind of crazy to think about stopping my ""5 minutes per week"" rule, but this feels like the right finish line. I've never stuck with any sort of diet for even close to 2 years. I'm so grateful I found fasting, changed my relationship with food and hunger, and learned I'm much better at controlling ""when"" I eat even if I still kind of suck at ""what"" and ""how much"" haha. I really encourage anyone who's struggling with the length of their fasting goal to try something like this (same goes for anyone nervous about starting).

7037,Breastfeeding &amp; IF. Tips? Commiserate ?,"First off, yes I know. You're not supposed to fast while breastfeeding. I read the book. I'm doing it anyways. I've been BF-ing for over a year and have a freezer full of milk, so I'm not worried about supply. Also I don't really buy into this idea that losing weight will release toxins into the breast milk. I lost loads of weight naturally with my first and he is totally fine. I breastfeed maybe 3 to 4x/day, more when baby is sick. Baby is a great eater, so BF-ing is just as much a comfort as it is a food source.

Anyhow, this go-around I am *not* losing the baby weight with ease *and* I have actually been gaining weight, which is why I'm giving IF a try. I've been doing 17-hour fasts +/- an hour or two. It's pretty easy actually - I love coffee in any form (totally okay with straight espresso for breakfast) and we eat dinner/go to bed embarrassingly early so it makes it pretty easy. My issue is with the feasting. Ugh. Once I start eating, my hunger is insatiable! I just graze and graze and graze. I'm sure fatigue/breastfeeding/boredom is playing a role, but honestly I also just feel legitimately hungry!

I fast 16:8.  When I started, my window was planned for 11a-7p because I'm a snacker/late eater. It was ok but I didn't notice any benefit other than curbing some hunger, cutting calories, wrangling my BE disorder. I was already keto and this just helped streamline things. Waiting for coffee at 11 to break fast was torture, as I'm up each day at 630-7. 

So I decided to change window to 10-6 to better fit and allow me my coffee earlier. Def worked better, noticed a little creep down on scale but could be attributed to the keto. Worked for a bit.

But then I started a new job, and am out of the house super early. (I'm a nurse) No way I could have my coffee at 10-11 and function from 8 am so I adjusted again and now hover at 830-430/9-5 fast.

I'm really happy about this because I was about to switch to 186 and I don't think that would have been sustainable for my lifestyle.

7078,"(Intermittent) Fasting is Powerful, But Its Not a Magic Bullet [X-Post from /r/fasting]","Hey everyone, Im going to give some very straight talk here in my post. This is something I have first hand experience with when I was thinking foolishly that I could do OMAD on big macs and fries. McDings may mince their beef but Im not going to mince words.

Fasting is not a magic bullet to lose weight. Thats right. Just because you fast, especially intermittent fasting, doesnt mean you will lose weight.

If you're still overeating during your feeding windows, whatever it may be, you will struggle to lose any weight. If youre doing 18:6 or even OMAD you can easily overeat. Especially...

...If youre eating a bunch of shitty, processed foods or refined carbs during your feeding windows you will struggle to lose weight.

If you have a junk food addiction (I definitely did) and dont take steps to address that addiction you will relapse and struggle to lose weight. If you have this problem, you need to do a 3-5 day fast. Lock yourself in a padded room if you have to. You need to break that sugar/junk food cycle. I promise it will work.

If you dont exercise, it will take much longer to reach your goal. That can be the difference between losing and not losing. You dont have to kill yourself like David Goggins. Go for a walk if thats your style.

You still need to eat a healthy diet of WHOLE, UNPROCESSED FOODS.

You still need to avoid all sugars, seed oils, refined grains and processed foods.

You still need to avoid overeating. 

Lastly, you need to be savagely honest with yourself about what you're doing if you arent losing weight. If you come on here and say ""Im eating normally during my window and cant lose."" And you secretly know that ""Eating normally"" is a healthy meal of meat an vegetables... with a double portion size... that ends with half a sleeve of oreos at midnight... you get the picture.

I know if I have a large lunch I often don't feel like dinner so figured that could be a way to return to the rhythm of IF.

7129,Warrior Diet has been amazing for me,"I might have found the best diet for me.   


Just started on the Warrior diet where I only eat between 5:00/6:00 and 9:00/10:00 pm.   
   
16:8 unfortunately did not work for me. If I eat lunch, I start snacking during the day, and I get very hungry during the night before I go to sleep. I end up going over my calorie intake. Instead, I now go on with my day forgetting about food and then start eating well a few hours before bed. 

Now, It's actually getting difficult to get to \~1500 calories in my eating window. It's quite insane to me that weeks ago I would eat 2500 calories a day easily.   
Bonus is that I get to still go out with my friends and have drinks/unhealthy dinner without it impacting my daily calorie intake.   


For anyone struggling with 16:8 for the same reasons, try this out! I only wish I started earlier.

I'm a 5'11' woman who weighs 202lbs. One year ago I weighed 230lbs and I've slowly been losing weight but it's been a lot of up and down. My goal weight is 160lbs.

I'm brand new to IF. I'm on day 2 and using the 18:6 plan - my eating window is 6am to noon. It's been honestly easier than I was worried it would be, thank goodness, but I know I have a long road ahead of me. 

I'm getting married in August this year and I'd like to lose as much weight as possible by then, but my fiance and I often enjoy drinks &amp; eating out on the weekends. My question for all of you is how much will it slow my weight loss if I do my usual 18:6 IF for the 5 weekdays and then enjoy some drinks &amp; dinner on the town on the 2 weekend days? 

Will this seriously inhibit the amount of weight I could lose by my wedding?

I IF'd my way to fantastic weight loss a few years ago (when combined with a calorie deficit) and sporadically for health purposes I have practiced 16-8 IF for weeks at a time (whilst maintaining weight).  


I was in a conversation with an acquaintance who suggested that autophagy really kicks in around the 15 hour mark. That got me thinking - with my 16 hour-max fasts, was I truely seeing the full range of potential health benefits?

So I'm planning on doing a 24 hour fast and it was suggested, before I proceed would be a fantastic opportunity to get some markers / blood / analysis down. As I am not in a position to ask which specifically they meant, I thought I would try this community.

I would love to have some quantifiable data on how the fasts have affected or changed things in my body. I think a before and after could prove very interesting (regardless of whether there are any changes). The problem is, I don't know what to test for. The kind of terms that were mentioned were quite technical and I cannot remember them, however I believe blood glucose or something insulin resistance related was amongst them.

Can anybody help?",intermittentfasting,1651595854
7148,6+ year water fast veteran with many 5-7 day fasts done. Dry Fasted for the first time. My thoughts,"As the title says, I‚Äôve been in this game for a long while. I do IF everyday and do extended fasts of 24+ hours at least once a week with a longer one each quarter on average. I only say this as pretext for my thoughts on a dry fast.

I‚Äôve been seeing more and more about dry fasts. I never seriously considered them because I believed drinking water was so important for getting through the fasting days. I still do. 

I also just thought cutting out water was insane, but two days ago I thought to myself, ‚Äúpeople think IF and extended fasts are insane. Hell, I did before my journey.‚Äù So I started a dry fast, just a day (technically almost 36 hours). 

Pros:
-Actually was just as easy if not easier than water fasting.
-Didn‚Äôt get a bump in my weight from hydrating in the morning.
-Felt great mostly.
-Lost weight rapidly, 2 pounds over the day.
-Skin/fat felt more pliable while looking tighter.
-Motivation was focused on not drinking and I never thought about food like I might when I‚Äôm just restricting calories/food.
-Water this morning was like heaven, in the same way food is like heaven after longer fasts.

Cons:
-Headache. Not the whole day but most of it.
-Although I felt great, I was more sluggish than during water fasts.
-Couldn‚Äôt have my coffee.
-Heightened ‚Äúworry‚Äù/awareness about my internal functions, e.g. heart beat, any soreness from exercise, etc.

I don‚Äôt know the real benefits of dry fasting. I didn‚Äôt do much research like I have done for IF and EF. This was just an experiment and overall it was very good. I actually quite enjoyed it. 

That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it unless you‚Äôre a veteran and want to experiment/try something new. Water is so important for your body, obviously. Yes, you can make your own water but I just feel a bit better during water fasts. There‚Äôs not a major con to point to and there are so many positives but something just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me about dry fasting, especially when considering whether to recommend it to others. 

In the end, I might do it again in the future, just a day, but only if I have a specific weight loss goal I‚Äôm struggling to hit. Water fasting provides the weight loss well enough if you do it correctly and still has all the benefits for your body such as autophagy and insulin effects, etc. 

I‚Äôm not a doctor. I‚Äôm not an expert, technically lol. So do what you will, this was just my experience that I wanted to share as I see more and more about dry fasting. 

Height: 5‚Äô11‚Äù SW: 177.6 lb CW: 174.8 lb Current time fasted: 43.5 hours. Time dry fasted: ~34 hours CW after rehydrating: 175.6 lb Starting body fat: 17.9% CBF: 17.3%

As I wrote those numbers, it came to mind that while the dry fasting definitely boosted my fat loss, I probably would be down a solid 1-2 pounds just from water fasting, from my experience in the past. So like I said, unless I‚Äôm struggling with just a couple pounds, I‚Äôd stick to water fasting. It‚Äôs about patience and long term goals rather than short bursts of weight loss that can easily be gained back. After rehydration, you can see I‚Äôm about where I would be after the same time of water fasting. However, I take my weight immediately in the morning before having any liquids. I‚Äôll typically gain about a pound on the scale after drinking. So while the numbers show my weight after rehydration being about where they‚Äôd be just with water fasting, it‚Äôs comparing the number I‚Äôd be after a water fast in the morning (before hydration) to the number after hydration of a dry fast, so it‚Äôs still a significant difference. (I‚Äôd be in the 176.5 range rather than 175.5 range, if I solely water fasted.)

I hope that made any sense. I started writing and added more and more. I‚Äôm currently on a significant weight loss/health journey and am nearing the end so I‚Äôll post an update on that journey probably this month, with pics most likely. (As a tease, I‚Äôm down 30 pounds in 3 months and 40 pounds from my max weight.)

Maybe it‚Äôs because it wasn‚Äôt a conscious effort, but it wasn‚Äôt as hard as I thought it would be. I feel pretty refreshed and clear headed, just a tad low on energy, but I am getting my burger after all, lol.

7268,First month in doing IF,"SW 238 lbs CW 225 GW 175 M 50 5ft 9"" UK

Just want to say a big thank you to everyone participating in this group, it's been great motivation and lots of useful information.

Two weeks before I began IF, I completely stopped drinking diet fizzy drinks (mainly Fanta) with artificial sweeteners. I believe sweeteners actually made my cravings for junk much worse. Giving this up after a life time was a big change.

One week before I then stopped chocolate, cookies, crisps (chips) and sweeties, this was probably 80+% of my daily food. My cravings were less than I expected.

So far in my first month doing IF I've lost 13 lbs. My first week went great and I lost 8lbs, in my second week I was feeling really motivated because of the rapid loss and the overall ease doing IF so I actually cut out some more of my bad foods and actually ate less as I didn't replace the bad with anything. I was really confident in the second week, my headaches and upset tummy I had in the first week had gone. But when I weighed myself my weight loss had stalled, one day I gained a pound, next day I lost it. This has gone on for the next few weeks, although overall still the weight trickles down. I was a bit confused how eating less and marginally better didn't continue my rapid loss, I was also being slightly more active as well after the first week and had gone from doing a minimum of 16:8 to up to 23:1/OMAD on some days.

Did my body just go ""hell no, and hold on for dear life to what I was loosing? Did I convert fat to muscle, nah? Was it water weight retention? What the heck is water weight lol? My face has always been overly puffy/chubby is that water weight? How the hell does anyone even know whether they have water weight and what's the silver bullet to emptying it out? I'm thinking water retention might just be my fantasy, it's not all the crap I eat, it's the evil water's fault ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜ

Anyhoo what I've learned in my first month, everyone's body is different don't assume you'll do the exact same as any particular person. Understand that this isn't really a diet or a succeed/fail type situation with any deadline. With IF you can if necessary take a day off, a week off, whatever. You didn't fail, it's okay and normal that life, family, friends, shit just happens. Just go back to doing IF the day after! There is no failure as long as you restart again. Previously on diets when I cracked and binged, I always decided I'd failed and completely gave up, that's a fatal mistake. Just carry on again where you left off.

I'd love to keep loosing 8 lbs a week, it would be quick and awesome, but I'm thinking don't be a dumbass it's taken me 30 years of abuse of food to get to this mess I'm in, realistically it's not going to be magically done in weeks or even a few months. 

I've had depression, anxiety and insomnia for between 25-30 years. I've lived on crap food and junk to get boosts of happiness and energy even though those boosts are short lived and long term make your symptoms worse. 

My diet is still poor. I'm addicted to this stuff and I've cut out loads of crap that I previously ate all day long, so even just reducing this to 8 hours is a help. 5 days a week when not fasting I'm drinking about 1 litre a day of pure 99% tomatoe juice (180 calories) most days I have soup for lunch or a tin of baked beans with a small amount of BBQ sauce. My dinner is provided free from my work as a food delivery driver, it's Chinese and so either a portion of chicken, beef or duck with pancakes, all meals come in a sauce. I know it's not an ideal choice but it's saving me money I can't afford to waste right now and I'm still loosing weight so I'm sticking with it. My 2 days off, I have 1 treat junk meal each day but that's all I have with 1/2 litre of Tomato Juice. When fasting I only have water. I don't like teas or black coffee and my local tap water is good. My cravings for sugar are there on occasion but minimal. When I get sick of water I know my tomato juice is round the corner. 

Previously I didn't eat because I felt hungry, for 30 years I've eaten for happiness. Now my stomach gets full with a lot less, I'd say I am noticing tiny improvement in my mood and oomph/energy/motivation, feeling less low, and the sunshine being out has also encouraged me to get busy in the garden, even just cutting the grass when it doesn't need it, keeps me moving and helps my head.

Sorry this has turned into chapter 187, paragraph 12, sub section (d) in length. In a nutshell IF so far is really working for me, anyone new to this don't rush it, start gradual just keep slowly adding in new improvements, don't fixate on the scale, be proud of yourself for only eating a maximum 8 hours a day instead of 20 hours! If you need time off, don't sweat it, just go back to IF straight after, there is no failing. Keep reading the posts here and take part in comments. You can do this too! This time it is actually different.

I even spend a 3-6 hours a day I in moderate to high ketosis most days.

7277,"40M/ 5‚Äô9 / SW 221 / CW 181, playing the long con","TL;DR:  I use 16:8 as my daily minimum window.  I eat lean protein and allow goodies in moderation.  I exercise but not as a priority every week.  Stay hydrated, my friends.  Lost 40 lbs.


The rules I follow are basic:
16:8 window minimum.  My window opens noon to 8pm, but sometimes I wait longer and end the window earlier.  Noon to 8 is my non-negotiable window perimeter.

Mediterranean food mostly.  I gave up ground beef, pork.  I eat lean beef, chicken, salmon, shrimp, eggs for protein.  I have vegetarian meals to keep it balanced.  My favorite go-to meal is an oatmeal, granola, mixed raw nuts, applesauce, Greek yogurt and frozen mixed berries mix.  

I don‚Äôt drink alcohol, but if I were, it would be in moderation and within my eating window. I just have to take a blood thinner and it‚Äôs easier to monitor if I‚Äôm not drinking.

Exercise- I don‚Äôt always prioritize exercise.  There are days I will exceed 10k steps, get a small workout in.  Other days, I‚Äôll prioritize relaxation.  If I prioritize exercise, I drop 2 lbs a week.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs maintenance.

What I allow myself in the AM before I can eat:  black coffee, water, or herbal tea.

When my window closes, water or herbal tea.  But I tend to be hydrated by the time 8pm rolls out so I don‚Äôt necessarily need anything.

I do not allow diet soda outside my window no matter what.  I love coffee and tea, but I enjoy dt Mountain Dew on occasion, but I keep it within my window to simplify the equation. 

I lost 10 lbs in the first like 2-3 weeks because I did OMAD mostly.  The rate of weight lost was about 10 lbs every two months, but it depended on activity, if I snacked between meals, how much I consumed, etc.  I didn‚Äôt care about short term losses, I was more thinking about getting to milestones eventually and more importantly, not bouncing back up in weight.  I‚Äôm now 40 lbs lighter.  I‚Äôm looking to eventually drop another 10, but my priority is more focused on NSV and general health.",intermittentfasting,1654526988

7281,Thank you..,"I posted on here a few weeks ago regarding whether I should start IF for non-weight loss purposes. I suffer from extreme bloating, a slight eating disorder triggered by bloat, and unable to control what I eat. The only reason I'm in shape is because I exercise A LOT.

I decided to post anyways. What I received was nothing but encouragement, suggestions and support.


It's been 3 weeks. My weight has stayed the same (5'6, 118lbs) but I haven't experienced bloat for the past 2 weeks. Last night, I had some friends came over with some wine, chips and cheese, all my favourites. When my cut off time is done, I said 'no thanks' and stopped eating with no problem. When they left, I broke down crying in joy. I have NEVER ever been able to control my appetite like that. Food has controlled me and my mind my entire life. And I allowed myself to sleep in this morning without feeling obligated to run 10k to burn off the food I ate.

I'm constantly hearing people who promote IF that you should ""skip breakfast"" and start eating around lunch time.  I've also heard that you shouldn't snack much, even if it is within your eating window.  


How accurate are these statements?  I usually have a protein shake in the morning, and have dinner at either 4:30 or 5:30 after I go to the gym.  I don't snack after that point, but I do have some snacks between meals.  I am having 3 meals a day still within this time.    


Would I be seeing different results if I was eating later in the day vs in the morning?  
Is having healthy snacks between my meals doing something to my metabolism/insulin that would otherwise be better if I didn't?

1) Medication/Vitamins: I take one 60mg Cymbalta for depression every morning, along with a multivitamin, some VitaProteins hair/nail supplements, and a medication for high blood pressure. I also have been prescribed 30mg phentermine by my Dr. to assist with losing weight. I plan to do either the 20-4 or 18-6, and since I plan to eat after work as a treat for myself instead of drinking, I will eat starting at 3pm. So, if I take my meds in the morning like I always do, is this officially breaking a fast? I don‚Äôt know about taking Phentermine that late in the day‚Ä¶ and same w the other medications. I suppose I can take the vitamins/supplements &amp; omega fish oil (I take that w meals) later with the meal. Thoughts?

2) Exercise: I have had great results working out on an empty stomach in the past. On IF, I‚Äôm wondering if working out early in the morning is going to be too tough. If I plan to eat starting at 3 or 4pm, should I try to squeeze in a quick workout right before I‚Äôm allowed to eat? I just plan to do 30 min cardio for now and then up it to weights/45 min cardio.

7420,29/f one month progress SW 185.4 - CW 170.6 - GW 154,"Hi everyone!
I wanted to do a month update because I‚Äôve just had the most incredible weight loss month of my life. 29/f SW 185.4 CW 170.6 (30 days) GW 154. I feel like I‚Äôve finally truly found my groove with fasting and keto. I do not believe you HAVE to be keto to do IF but it makes life a lot easier for me. I have done OMAD in the past (non keto) and it was unfortunately maintenance for me so I had to up my game ultimately to ADF. Years ago I did keto and lost 40 pounds that I maintained around 170 for several years but during Covid I ate like an absolute animal, shout out to my husband who is an incredible chef and baker. 

Anyways, I am a Merchant Mariner aka Sailor and currently on an American cargoship overseas, that means all my food is prepared by the galley staff and in general it‚Äôs stuff I have no problem saying no to. I think I have an advantage there because I‚Äôm not cooking for a family and it‚Äôs very easy for me to avoid meal times when I am fasting. The downside is my job can be extremely physical and it was hard to get use to ADF at first. I don‚Äôt think ADF is something to go straight into this isn‚Äôt my first month fasting and I didn‚Äôt feel like a beginner when I started this month. Anyways this month I did 20/4 for a weekish, OMAD for less than a week, tried some 42 hour fasts ((failed) then tried again)), eventually it turned into ADF after listening to this episode of my now favorite woman‚Äôs fasting based podcast -[The Fasting Method episode 5](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fasting-method-podcast/id1593883196?i=1000544199478), it truly changed my outlook and ADF just clicked. I trusted the two hosts/fasting coaches that ADF was the gold standard for weightloss for women and they were right!

I am also working out 3 days a week. 

Scale says I have lost about 3 pounds and I obviously can‚Äôt tell much yet in just a week (I started Monday) but is this the right approach? As I lose weight, MyFitnessPal will adjust calories and I will adjust my eating to that.

Even got my ‚Äúbreakfast is the most important meal of the day‚Äù boyfriend to not only try IF, but he‚Äôs even more committed than me.. doing OMAD! I follow a 16:8 or 18:6 most days. 

I recently purchased a CGM to experiment with how different foods affect my blood sugar and correlate that to how I‚Äôm feeling. All of that to say, after fasting for the 16-18 hours, my blood sugar is around 70 mg/dL. Once I break that fast, how much is considered a healthy increase? (I follow a fairly low carb diet but no where near keto). Typically I break my fast with a large salad of just greens and veggies (with a homemade olive oil / vinegar /spices dressing), a side of protein (chicken, egg, or steak) and 2-3 small chunks of cheese. (Sort of a deconstructed Cobb salad). I am finding that if I don‚Äôt include a fattier side, I end up shooting up to 125-130. If I include a fattier side, I‚Äôll stay under 100. Am I losing any weight loss benefits by shooting up to that 130 mark?

7451,Pls help a clueless newbie: How to deal with challenging schedules?,"Dear all,

Wow this community is so inspiring!! Sorry if this question had been asked before but I couldn't find it in the search and really need some advice. I tried googling but answers really differ and left me more clueless than before. 

I started IF 2 weeks ago. I have been doing 16-8, on some days 15-9 or 14-10 (I have small kids, so when they wake me up really early it's hard to get to 16 hours...). I really love it and changed so many habits already, like constant snacking. 

However, I am currently on a leave from work and have no idea how to stick to IF once I get back. I have a job I  love but it involves a lot of travel, long hours, and late dinners with clients and colleagues 3-4 times a week. Most of these things I cannot change (I could maybe occassionally try to skip a dinner, but not all of them, and not eating would be really considered weird). Right now I eat dinner with my kids at about 6pm, but once I am back to work, most nights I'll still be working at 6pm and it's just not feasible that I get dinner that early. Of course there'll still be nights where I'll be home, but probably 4 nights a week I'll be working late/traveling. And on the nights where I'm home I'll also sometimes want to meet friends which also involves late dinner/drinks (of course, this is something I could change but tbh I don't want to be the person that drinks tea at a bday celebration).

I guess if I only finish dinner at 10 or 11pm I could try to not eat until 1pm the next day - does someone follow that schedule? It would still only be about 14 hours, and I don't know how well I can focus in the morning when waking up at about 7am and having to work. Usually now I wake up around 7 and eat at 10am and the last hour is rather tough (that's why, if my kids wake me at 6am, I sometimes don't make it to 10am).

Also, on nights where I am home I would try to eat at 6-7pm again as late dinners don't make me feel good.

I am sure many of you have similar scheduling challenges. What do you do if work and travel doesn't let you stick to a set schedule and lead to really late dinners?

Please don't tell me I should change jobs lol. I know it doesn't sound super healthy but it's really a great job with great opportunities and I would like to find a way to integrate IF in my schedule.

Thanks!!",intermittentfasting,1654236657

Healthy lunch, followed by some protein heavy snacks and dinner. Yesterday had a dinner out and I managed to stick to my budget which I usually blow when going out.

Earlier this month I had day surgery, a tubal litigation. Which means bed rest, and definitely no crazy exercises for a few weeks. I had a plan in place, was gonna keep fasting, drink mostly liquids to avoid eating too much and not taking in too many calories. 

But then the surgery came and everyone wanted to bring me delicious takeout. And did I say no? Of course not. 

I use the Fastic app, so I used about 5 or 6 frosties over the course of a week. My husband would bring fast food when he got home from school at 10:00 pm for us. Three meals a day, constantly laying around, always wanting to eat. 

But I recognized I was on the fast track to undoing everything I worked hard for. 20+ lbs may not seem like much but if I gained that back I‚Äôd probably gain more than that even. I know myself. 

So I started doing 12 hour fasts to ease myself back into the groove but not overwhelm myself. It‚Äôs still a struggle, but I try to do 12 hours minimum and not eat more than twice a day. I managed to even lose a few more pounds. I still can‚Äôt exercise like I was but in a few weeks I can get back to it.

Then I got a high stress job and decided I‚Äôd eat out again 2-3xs a day. My needed calorie intake was 2000. I was eating 2500-4500 two or three times a week.

I went from size 36 waist to 32, then back up to a snug 34. Hit a peak of 223lbs again. That‚Äôs a +37lbs gain. I had gone from a tight XL to a snug Medium. (I‚Äôm still medium in sweatshirts)

I then spent a week on the moon with the devils weed (lol). I know I gained a ton that week. Refused to weigh myself during this week.

Then, this week began and I decided to begin IF again. Started a few days with 16:8, now doing 36:1 or OMAD.

Started at 218. Now down to 211lbs.

My point with this post is to share that even if you derail and gain some, remember wheee you started. You‚Äôve come a long way. Don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt give in.

Kaizen. Small steps.

I should be back down to 186lbs by June 9th.

Eating healthy food isn't my issue, as I personally enjoy it but sometimes I have trouble with timings.

7548,Metabolic effects of diet sodas,"The question of diet sodas breaking a fast comes up so often here, I thought I'd share this [study](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/12/2184) that I ran across.

The result of the study is that, yes, diet sodas have a metabolic effect, BUT it triggers a glucagon response--not insulin. If you don't know what glucagon is, it's the reciprocal hormone of insulin. It's released by the pancreas in response to low blood sugar, and it causes the liver to release glucose from your glycogen stores, which is what typically happens anyway while you're fasting (assuming that you even have glycogen stores remaining--i.e. not in ketosis).

But before you get all excited about drinking diet sodas as a way to deplete your glycogen to get into ketosis, the findings are that this glucagon response occurs with a glucose load--i.e. it wouldn't happen if you're fasting. 

But there are points made in this study that are directly pertinent to the question of do diet sodas break a fast?

&gt;Because artificial sweeteners were given by mouth in the form of diet soda, one might hypothesize that increases in insulin and GLP-1 were due to cephalic-phase insulin release. This is unlikely, because cephalic-phase insulin release typically occurs 2‚Äì10 min after taste exposure and does not occur with pure oral glucose or artificial sweeteners (8), and cephalic-phase GLP-1 response has not been observed in humans (9).

In trying to explain why drinking diet soda prior to a glucose load would trigger a glucagon response, they considered the same cephalic insulin release that people always mention about drinking diet sodas, but this study ruled that out as even happening.

Let me reiterate this point: cephalic insulin release DOES NOT occur with pure oral glucose or artificial sweeteners.",intermittentfasting,1618385924

I have scrolled through many posts about people complaining they do not lose weight after months of fasting, and I do know that it takes time for the body to get accustomed to the fasting and I should not be discouraged.
And most of the time the only other answer was calorie counting. Due to specific circumstances and personal  reasons, calorie counting is very difficult for me to try and implement into my daily lifestyle. I just can't see myself doing that.
I also can just NOT stop eating carbs. I'd rather die than ditch pasta, rice and potatoes... So Keto is absolutely out of the question for me. I'm sorry guys I just love food to much, haha.

So, I was thinking, if I try OMAD and I really do pay attention to not eat too many high calorie ingredients, it should put me at the deficit that I need.

However, I've also heard some great things about 5:2 and I was wondering which one of those 2 would be more beneficial for healthy and active weight loss. 

I guess OMAD makes me consume less calories than 5:2, but the 2 day fasting window might bring some really noticeable results too, due to my body being in ketosis.

I have however quit smoking. Almost one month ciggy free! I've also been a lot healthier in my choices and I just joined a CrossFit gym! Going for my first class today. Hopefully with the extra exercise added into my routine I'll start to see results.

You dont even have to gym! You can walk and continue to count those steps you boast about all the damn time. You can be a ""lazy fuck"" (eve. Though you aren't because you work) and still lose some weight to get you started.  

Then they start to get a lil antsy and make excuses why they can't do it and I'm like, can't do what exactly?? Not eat every second of the day? Not prioritize a schedule of eating within an 8-10hour window?? HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU NEED???? Cant ween yourself off fatty, sugary foods/drinks, even slooowly??

Due to my upbringing (mom who always tried different diets/calorie counting etc.) I have always been strongly against counting calories and never bothered to learn how to do it.

Anyway on top of IF, I have been focused on making homemade meals as opposed to take out. So recently I have been topping up my veggie intake a lot. A typical meal at the beginning of my feeding window would consist of a spinach omelette (1egg, cup of spinach) or mashed cauliflower (1/4 or 1/3 of cauliflower head depending on size) for lunch. Toward the end of my feeding window I eat my main meal usually some sort of veggies, chicken and occasionally rice. For dessert I'll take a square of dark chocolate.

Now this is waaaay less calories than my previous eating habits which consisted of a lot of pizza, burgers and chips. But I'm not very well versed in calories and am unsure if the calorie deficit is too much?

I feel fine and more energetic than a few weeks ago. So I've been assuming if this is too little calories for my body it would signal that by feeling bad right?

For months, I was actually thinking of how I didn't want to eat dinner and that I was forcing myself just out of habit. IF is already helping me mentally! My only real side effect has been feeling colder toward the end of fasting.

However, I need some ideas of how you would handle my schedule.

Monday through Thursday: Can easily do 18:6, eating between 6am and noon.

Friday: Go for 24 hours from noon until noon on Saturday.

On weekends, I would like to have a cheat meal or two for sanity and it's really the only day I actually want dinner. Also, I'd love to have wine or gin and tonics on Saturday night.

Sunday breakfast would be nice, but I can definitely forego lunch and dinner. 

Any thoughts or ideas? Should I just make Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning an eating period? This way I would get to fast 18:6 from Sunday to Monday.

Would this type of schedule impede my progress too much? My idea of a cheat would be 2 servings of alcohol, and a high carb meal such as some pizza, pasta, or something like a burger. Sunday breakfast would be minced pork noodles. 

I'm okay with slower progress as a trade off for higher sustainability over time.

Wake up at 10 am most days

\- Heat up an egg muffin or make a chia seed pudding/omelet  
\- Drink sweetened cold brew which is around 20-30 calories depending on how much I drink that day

Lunch at 3 or 4 pm (This is what I ate today)

\- Indian chickpea curry without any rice or naan. I sub rice with 1 oz of dry quinoa. Some roasted cauliflower

That's pretty much it. If I'm hungry (like today), I eat healthy snacks like sweet potato chips, almonds, or some strawberries around 7 pm. 

Me snacking at 7 pm is putting me at 14-15 hours of fasting. Sometimes my fasting period is lower because I get hungry.

Do you do it everyday or only some days?

What time do you eat? Mid-day, Dinner time? 

As someone prone to binging, I worry that eating one large meal will reinforce bad habits that I have worked really hard to break and continually have to keep in check.  

I work 7-4 and if I ate one meal I would want to cook it and not eat it in a hurry at work.  In the past when I eat one meal it is usually on a day off and because I had a big lunch and just didn‚Äôt want dinner.

I have a small build so my stats don‚Äôt really do justice to the fact that I look and feel sloppily overweight at 157lbs. I have done no carb diets in the past and have had great success but at this point in my life I want to eat the freaking carbs if I feel like it. The no carb thing is super boring to me.

I‚Äôve seemed to have hit a plateau and tried extending my fast for a reset but no luck.  I‚Äôve continuously worked out, weight lifting and running, as a calorie burning method however my goal in the future is to get into weightlifting and building a good amount of muscle. 

My current rough schedule, on working days, is I workout around 8-9am for about a hour to hour and a half.  I go into work at 1230pm and my eating window is 4-8pm.  I do keep this schedule when off (rotating 5 on/5 off schedule) to be able to eat with the family).  Obviously my muscle gains aren‚Äôt what they would be if I were feeding the protein after a workout. 

My question is should I continue this and settle for the small muscle gains?  Should I adjust my eating window on working days to fuel my body before/during/after my workout and on non-working days adjust it to a later workout or workout as I am now with no fuel afterwards?  During it all I would love to continue to see my body change to lose fat.

Backstory on me In high school and uni I was just in general focusing on school/weed/gaming/partying and never really cared about my health and was pretty much in the overweight category since starting high school. Never really went to the gym either.

So last sept I started IF 16:8 and did pretty well until Christmas but was still eating out a decent bit and pretty shitty foods, but I still lost like 11 pounds. So I realized that I could lose some real weight if I started exercising and eating right. Started omad and healthy eating since Christmas basically and cooking all my meals at home lot of chicken and vegetables. Was doing weights and daily cardio. I hit what I thought would be my goal weight 170 at the end of feb and started mixing in some cheat days more often etc. Since then I‚Äôve just been floating around 168-172 pretty much since the start of March.

The reason I want to cut to 155 ( lightweight class for any of you ufc fans out there) is that I still feel like my bot fat % is pretty high for my weight and since I never went to the gym before my muscle mass is pretty low, and also just to see if I can do it. then healthily bulk and put the weight back on.

The last few years have been difficult for me, from losing my mum, taking care of and eventually losing my grandpa, and the tipping point was losing my dog. I know it sounds crazy but that hit me hardest. I had food as my only release and I was using it to mask the guilt, sadness and anger I had.

I've found the only motivator that works for me is channeling my anger when exercising. No music, just an hour every day to process my thoughts and have a conversation with myself. The result is a calmer me at work and less urges to spend/eat.

In the long run this is probably not the healthiest motivator, but for now it works. I'm not sure what my goal weight is, probably whenever my body doesn't look like a peanut with tits.

7734,Updating my Goal Weight,"Hi folks‚Äî not as happy of a post as the title might seem. I‚Äôm 21 years old, 5‚Äô5, and recently swung up to my highest weight ever (hit 201 a few weeks ago) after doing IF consistently for the last year and a half (520 day streak!). I started doing IF for weight loss. When I first started in August of 2019, I was 180 aiming for 160 as my primary goal and 140 as my secondary goal weight to maintain at. By March, I had hit 155 lbs. Even in quarantine, I stayed fairly active and was able to maintain for a while. 

However, without changes in activity since the beginning of quarantine (for the most part), I gained back everything I lost and then some. To be completely fair, I started eating some meat again, but never incorporated meat fully back into my diet and often prefer vegetarian and tofu options. I was even gaining weight after stepping up from 18-6 to 20-4. For the longest time, I didn‚Äôt log my weight because it was so depressing to see that everything I‚Äôd worked for was gone. Going on this sub was even worse- how could nobody else seem to have this problem? 

After lots of tears and an actual change in my diet (so much salad) I went into my fasting app and changed my goal weight. The 160 just felt like it was mocking me at this point. I‚Äôve set my new goal to get down to 180 and go from there. 

I‚Äôm posting this for accountability, but also because it‚Äôs hard to see all these wonderful posts about IF working for everyone within the community. I always want to share in their joy and congratulate them on their success, but my personal journey has been made harder and more heartbreaking by a lack of posts like this on this sub.

But  yo, we all have our friends who always seem to be trying some new sort  of dieting and exercise routine. They lose a little bit of weight but then go back to their old ways. I was there myself for about as long as I  can remember.

It just seemed that unlike other diets, IF was something I could actually maintain in the long run.

I have been a bit of a long time lurker, trying to figure out if I should do Intermittent Fasting, Keto or just normal calorie control. I‚Äôve finally decided to give Intermittent Fasting a try and I am excited and nervous too. 

I really want to lose weight and this is like a whole new beginning for me. I am 26 years old, a female, 5 feet 3 inches and about 78 kgs. My goal is to get to 58 kgs. It seems like a far away fantasy right now now but it‚Äôs a dream I hope I can make come true soon!!.

I was just looking for some inspiration, some do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs, tips, things you have learnt while doing Intermittent Fasting yourself and which may help me too... I had a few questions too...

1) I‚Äôm planning on starting with the 12 hour eating 12 hour fasting method and easing down the hours of eating and increasing the hours of fasting from there. Do you think this is a good idea?
2) What all do you suggest I eat? Can I open my fast with normal food and just eat in moderation normally whatever I eat? I usually eat rice and curry, or a sandwich, or stir fry and rice? I love rice... Should I stop eating rice altogether or is it okay? Or in your opinion, should I stay away from certain foods and eat only a certain food?
Also, a weight loss app is asking me to eat 1200 calories a day to lose weight. Do you think this will be healthy for me?
3) Do I need to fast every day of the week or should I give my body a break sometimes?
4) And lastly, how much exercise do you think I should put in?

I‚Äôm so sorry for all the questions. You don‚Äôt have to answer all of them...

I‚Äôve been intermittent fasting + keto because of high insulin for about six days now. The latter recommended by my doctor, the former I incorporated on my own. 

I was trying to do a longer fast today‚Äîwould have been 21 hours I think but I started not doing well. 

Shaky, very very cold clammy hands, blurry vision, numb legs, tingling in arms and in my face, heart palpitations, extreme shortness of breath, feelings of doom (I have ZERO hx of panic attacks/anxiety), clouded thinking, forgetfulness, feeling generally uncoordinated. 

I had had kosher salt (maybe a tsp?) earlier in the day to avoid imbalanced electrolytes. That being said I‚Äôm on a drug called spironolactone that spares potassium and makes me pee all the time. I‚Äôve been drinking PLENTY of water every since being on it. It also causes low bp. 

Today I also took my supplements: pumpkin seed oil (1000 mg‚Äî this is for hair loss, supposed to block DHT naturally) and 4,000 IU vitamin d. 

I had no idea if I was having hypotension (due to spiro) or hypoglycemia due to fasting. I ended up breaking my fast at 19 hours because I was flipping out. I had bone broth and a meal. 

I‚Äôm feeling just a touch better now, enough to write this, but very spooked and still short of breath and having some tingling and coldness. 

Is this just a really extreme version of what other people experience fasting? Or is this something to worry about?

If this seems like it‚Äôs from hypoglycemia‚Äîdoes that mean something is wrong with my liver for not adequately breaking down glycogen to keep me going while fasted??

I (29F) have been practicing intermittent fasting off and on for maybe 4 years now, so I‚Äôm not new to the experience. But during the past ~6 months I‚Äôve really fallen off track with eating healthily, fasting, working out, etc, so I set some goals to get on track this week.

I started 18/6 fasting 5 days ago. I‚Äôve also started doing 20-45 min strength/HIIT at-home workouts every day. I‚Äôve been eating healthy meals and haven‚Äôt strictly counted calories, but I‚Äôve definitely decreased my caloric intake (and I‚Äôm definitely within my ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù caloric window). I‚Äôd say my average daily caloric intake has been around 1400 (I‚Äôm a short woman!).

I‚Äôm not one to obsessively check the scale, but I thought today I‚Äôd check in to see where my progress was on day 5, and I‚Äôd gained a little over 5 lbs. 

In my past experience doing IF, I lose around that much in the first week and it feels so encouraging, so I‚Äôm just feeling really discouraged by that weigh-in. I‚Äôm definitely drinking a lot more water than usual, and I do feel bloated, so I guess it‚Äôs water retention? But again, this is atypical for me/my body, so I‚Äôm discouraged! I‚Äôm not much of a scale person anyways, so I‚Äôm trying to remind myself that it‚Äôs only one part of the picture and weight loss isn‚Äôt always linear. 

Has anyone else had this experience, or do you have any knowledge/advice/insight about weight gain during the first week of a fast?",intermittentfasting,1610484626

I'm willing to pay a fair amount, but at the same time I don't want to be spending hundreds of dollars a month for a service since I'll still need to go out and buy the groceries and meal prep.

7783,One day doing OMAD and my eyes are opened!,"I‚Äôve been doing 16:8 since July with no calorie counting and I‚Äôve only lost 5 pounds. I decided to switch to OMAD for the New Year. Worried that I wasn‚Äôt going to be eating enough, I measured my TDEE and calculated that I need about 1500 calories to lose weight. Tracked my one meal and it‚Äôs over 1500. I‚Äôve realistically been eating about 2500 calories a day with lunch/snacks/dinner, even if it‚Äôs been time restricted. 

Even though every post that complains about not losing weight has a response that says ‚Äúcount your calories‚Äù, I just didn‚Äôt want to admit to myself that I am eating way too much high calorie food. I desperately wanted to be in that magic category of people who are on IF and who don‚Äôt have to count calories. 

Since I basically eat the same 7 dinners every week, it‚Äôs not really that hard to count my calories for a week and make adjustments based on the 1500 calories goal.

So I've been doing IF for a little over a month now but struggling to see results. For the first 2 weeks, I tracked my macros religiously. While I felt better, I switched it up for the last 2.5 weeks. I have one ""snack"" and one meal for the day. I also started walking 9 miles 6 days of the week and incorporated weight lifting at least 3 days a week (I have barbell and dumbbell equipment) during this period. While I have lost a few pounds, definitely not as much as I thought I'd see.

My eating routine consists of this: 

1. Unsweetened matcha tea around noon 
2. Whey protein shake or 2-3  scrambled eggs or a can of tuna around 4pm with a banana
3. Grilled or oven-roasted protein with vegetables (e.g. oven-roasted half chicken with one sweet potato or grilled steak with grilled mushrooms) around 8pm
4. 2-3 Milkway minis for dessert
5. If I weight lifted, I'll have a casein protein shake before bed

7791,25F SW:228 CW:228 One Week Into 16:8,"Hello all! Super glad I found this subreddit! I am a 25F 5'5"" 228lb, and I just started IF 16:8 last Monday. My GW is 190 to start out, and then 140. I haven't been under 200 since 2013 when I graduated high-school. 

Along with the IF, I also cut out sodas completely, which Im actually surprised that I've been able to go a whole week without! I've been addicted to sodas for a long time, but I decided to finally cut them out. Even when going out to eat, I didn't get soda. All I've had to drink has been mostly water, some milk, and I have had maybe 2 lemonades? But that's about it. Mainly water, more water than I think I drank in the entirety of last year. I've also cut back on sweets and snacks in general.

This week has been something. I decided that I only eat between 10am and 6pm, to curb my nighttime snacking. I will not lie, once 8pm hit, I would get serious cravings for snacks, but I just made sure to just drink my water and get my mind off of food.

The hardest obstacle I had was on Thursday, when I started making dinner too late. I was making golden curry, which is my favorite meal EVER, but realized it wouldn't be done until after 6pm. Then, after the rest of my family ate, I went to put it away. Let me tell you, it was emotionally, mentally, and physically hard on me, to not snag a bite or two as I packed it away. But I managed to get it put away without breaking, and then went and chugged the rest of my water. I was exactly like SpongeBob in the episode where he first meets Sandy: ""I don't need it... I don't need it..."" *sweats profusely*

I'm super proud of myself for sticking with this so far. I think I do need to work on portion control. I tend to make too big of servings when I eat. But I am starting to listen to my body when it's full. I hopefully will start adding in workouts once my schedule calms down and I can figure out a good routine for myself. I already feel much better, my mom has even commented saying that my skin seems to have a nice glow to it. I'm also really happy that I have my family and friends supporting me.

Since the start of January I've been doing IF. About a week ago I also started the 60 day Insanity workout. Last week was rough as muscles were sore and tired, but I can tell it's getting slightly easier to keep up and my muscles don't hurt as much anymore, which is an awesome feeling! I'm also keeping up with CICO and logging meals and all of that (often under 1200 calories, limiting portions, drinking tons of water, cutting back alcohol, and trying hard to keep carbs down) but I haven't seen progress like I was expecting. 

I see a lot of you awesome people on here losing pretty quickly from the start and I don't see that on my end. I've lost maybe a pound or two.

The daily posts can be a little in the weeds, but they have a great wiki to get you started:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/start_brewing

I think coffee is one of those things where you can be as ""extra"" as you want, but you don't have to spend a ton of money to make a fantastic cup.  Many roasters will grind their beans for you, so investing in grinders or other high end equipment at the beginning stages (or even at the later stages) really isn't necessary.

I think especially for IF, learning coffee can be a rewarding activity that is genuinely useful.  A good bag of coffee will set you back $12-$20, and there are so many different types of beans and roasts and roasters, that finding what you like and learning how you best like it brewed becomes part of the journey.",intermittentfasting,1610468857

I made great progress with these issues since then and thought I would try IF to deal with my lockdown weight gain and motivate me to be healthier.

What drew me to the idea of IF was that I didn‚Äôt have to be too strict with my calorie intake as I physically can‚Äôt consume more than my recommended daily calories (1350cal) in my eating window. 

BUT now I am starting to feel myself starting to obsess about tracking my calories, macros, nutrient intake and working out.

My partner suggested that I put down my tracking app for a week and see if I feel less pressure. For some reason, the suggestion of that made me reel in horror! I hadn‚Äôt realised how much I have gone back to my old ‚Äúbad‚Äù habits in just 3 weeks.

I recently started intermittent fasting and in the beginning I wasn't sure if it would actually help me lose weight. I started off doing 16 hour fasts, which gradually increased to 18hrs and now I can easily do 20:4. 

I've managed to lose 10kg (22lb)  in 4 months and it amazes me how it really is all due to my diet. The most exercise I do is walk my dog for an hour daily, and maybe do some squats or arm exercises here and there. I'm really excited to continue this journey to reach a healthy weight, while forming better eating habits!  


I also started an excel spreadsheet which is what inspired me to write this post. I wasn't quite sure of how much weight I had lost until I actually looked at all the data. It's interesting how prior to fasting it took me 2 years to achieve a 16kg (35lb) weight loss, yet by fasting I've almost surpassed that in less than 6 months.

 But I've cut the amount I eat significantly, used to be all day, snacking, candy, sweets, big, BIG meals, etc now I eat once or twice a day (depending on meal size of first meal and then dinner if it was a small meal) no snacking, lots of water, no fast food, almost no sugar (I can eat one cookie now, as opposed to 9-10) as it makes me sick! And I've been eating more healthy foods, cooking at home as opposed to frozen box dinners. I'm not starving (it felt like it at first) and I can get to my eating time no problem now. I don't generally feel hungry after that window closes, so I know my body has adjusted to the meal times and sizes.

But.... I haven't seen any progress. My weight is the same, my body looks the same, the only thing that I feel like lets me know anything is happening is, my leggings go on a bit easier and I can pinch the fabric and pull it away from my leg, instead of it being really tight. 

Is this normal? I legit am eating way less, both in portion size and amount of times through the day. I eat 2pm-7pm, and drink a lot of water.

I am going to start my journey with the 22:2 method only eating between 6:30pm and 8:30pm each day. I figure this is a good start from me as I already seem to be doing this. I normally am not a breakfast or lunch eater and typically eat my meals once I get home from work Mo-Fri.

I think I generally have a good idea on what I need to do throughout the day but right now my main question is what I need to avoid when eating my single meal every day. Do I need to eliminate any specific food groups like carbs or sugars?

My loss isn't as great as some on here but I'm still proud of it, I had always been a bit of a tubby kid throughout high school and my junior year I got down to 170 lbs. I proceeded to get into a long term relationship where we would eat all the time and I gained it all back by the time I graduated high school. Finally I got out of that relationship in September and decided to improve myself instead of wallowing in the breakup and the loneliness of quarantine, leading to now!

7905,IF and Hypothyroidism,"


Hi everyone! 

First time poster and long time lurker here! 

A bit of a backstory: I had two babies in the span of 2.5 years and I gained lots of weight after my first baby which I was able to lose only partly. I have so far maintained (also throughout my last pregnancy) and I‚Äôve plateaued at my current weight for about 2 months.

My main issue is that after my second pregnancy I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (I‚Äôm currently medicated, 75mg Eutirox). I‚Äôve been doing 16:8 for 10 days and the scale hasn‚Äôt budged. I‚Äôm an experienced IF and it‚Äôs always worked for me, but it seems to have stopped doing so thanks to my thyroid.

Do you have any recommendations on other IF schedules that would help me get out of this plateau? Do you think OMAD or a 48h fast would help to get my metabolism going again?

Thanks in advance!",intermittentfasting,1610385130
7907,How to IF with chronic acid reflux?,"Posting for a friend:

I've been looking into IF for a while now and have seen so many good things about it. I'm physically disabled and have so many dietary restrictions that this is the most viable option for me. Unforunately, I have a hiatal hernia and when my stomach is empty I'm hit with painful acid reflux. Normally a tums or two calms it, but they have calories and I cannot eat sorbitol in the sugar free ones. I've tried a few antiacid pills, (zantac worked but now that's off the shelves). I'd love to hear some victory stories with IF from those with chronic acid reflux and how you've overcome it as well as some advice and other antiacids that may work.",intermittentfasting,1610384503
7908,Fasting and sleep,"I just finished my third week of 18:6 IF and it's been going well. The transition was easier than I expected; I've had relatively little hunger and when I do, it passes quickly.

However... last night was a terrible night of sleep. I woke up around 2 AM after four hours of sleep and was never able to get back to sleep. It's now almost 9 AM and I still have 3 1/2 hours left of my scheduled fast. I. Am. Starving. and have been for hours. 

I'm leaning toward ending my fast early given the inadequate night's sleep. I feel like that's already stressing my body and continuing to fast is making it worse. Being this hungry and it not going away feels like my body genuinely needs fuel, perhaps to compensate for the lack of sleep. 

Curious if others have experienced a correlation between a bad night's sleep and difficulty fasting. In my shoes, would you cut the fast short for the day or not?",intermittentfasting,1610384107

Instead of thinking ""it's one day, I can go off track"" I thought ""it's a great present to myself to stick to my commitment"".

This isn't to say you have to stick to IF/CICO on special days, if that feels good and right to you then go for it. I'm just so pleased with myself that I had the power to commit, the longer I practice IF/CICO the more I want to stick to it.

7915,IF brings out the worst in me - advice needed,"Hi everyone, please be nice to me despite the fact that I am an obvious fail. So a few weeks ago I finally started IF after I have been reading a lot about it. After countless failed changes of my lifestyle and nutrition it sounded like the right thing for me. A few years ago I was in the shape of my life but I was working out twice a day and eating extremely cautious and mindful. My current job doesn't allow me the workouts anymore and ofc, Home Office since last March and no breaks between meetings doesn't help.

Here is the thing: things got totally out of hand since I started and my scale is sky high, higher than it has ever been. I am very familiar with healthy nutrition, lots of proteins and veggies, enough water intake etc., but the fact that I have a time frame of 8 hours and the rest I am not allowed to eat messes with my head. Yesterday for example I noticed that I had only one hour left (was after a healthy mean with grilled chicken and grilled veggies and I was not at all hungry) and I did what I never do: I shoved an entire bag of crisps inside me. I usually never buy this stuff but since I started IF I buy really bad food and consume it. Of course I was sick after and got myself into a nice gastritis. Again.

I do drink plenty of water in the 16 hours, but I still get hungry and I hate that feeling more than anything in the world, especially when I try to fall asleep. I don't think it's a physical issue but more a mental thing - the fact that there is a ban for me of 16 hours to eat makes me panic to a degree that I sometimes can't function, I get dizzy and have anxiety attacks. And then binge eating with food I don't even like. I never thought I would be this person and additionally to putting on weight I lose all respect for myself. I feel terrible.

I do this for 6 days a week, with the 1 day a week being a ""cheat meal"", of typically 2000-3000 calories. Again, this is the only meal of the day. The plan is to carry on with this plan until goal weight, with the idea to move to a less restrictive diet afterwards to maintain the loss.

When the gyms re open, I plan to do cardio 5 days a week, at the moment my only exercise is going for a walk.

Is this sustainable? Any flaws in the plan? I'm also taking multi vitamins too and tend to just stick to water as a drink.",intermittentfasting,1610367618
7936,Working out early morning during IF,"I've done IF in the past but never stuck with it. I just started again with the 16:8 plan. 
 
I am working out as well 4 days a week with some push-ups, dips, and barbell curls. The issue is that I can only work out at the office before my coworkers come in which is around 6:30am. When I get home from work, I have to watch my baby twins which doesn't allow working out after work, unless I do it well after my feast window and that'll keep me up in bed. 

My fueling window is from 12p-8p, which means I won't be able to eat for another few hours after working out. Would this be considered a negative? I do eat large dinners around 6pm. 

I am a mesomorph with a large build but also right now a high BMI. I'm trying to maintain my muscle mass while shedding the fat. 6'0"" and 220lb with a goal of breaking 200lb.",intermittentfasting,1610366931

That combo is hitting me hard today. I do a 17:7 fast and I don't get to eat till 1. It's 11am my time now. All I can think about is food.

Is there a way I can make this easier on myself on bad days?

* 14/10 Fasting window

What gives?","For reference: I am 25f, ~120lbs looking to lose fat and gain muscle. Moderately active and aiming for a daily intake of 1300 net calories at 40/30/30 carbs/fat/protein 

I‚Äôve been tracking my macros, so I know I haven‚Äôt been eating any less than usual. I‚Äôm definitely hitting my caloric and macro needs in my 8hr period of eating. So why are my evening and morning fasts so much more difficult lately? 

Before, after the first month of adjusting, I could easily push thru the hunger, simply because it wasn‚Äôt ever that bad. But now, my desire for food is so intense that it physically hurts and distracts me from daily life. Nothing in my exercise, sleep or diet has changed, so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs triggering this change. 

My usual eating window is from 11 to 7 or 12 to 8. Around 4hrs into the fast and 2hrs before breaking it are absolutely hellacious. I always make sure to eat a good balance of protein, healthy fats and high fiber whole grains at dinner time, but for some reason it‚Äôs just not filling me up as it used to. 

I recently got a few tests done at the doc and my blood work and thyroid tests came back totally normal and healthy, so I‚Äôm definitely not deficient in anything or have a thyroid issue messing with my appetite. 

I am on 50mg daily of Zoloft, which is known to affect appetite, which could POSSIBLY be it, but I‚Äôm not sure!

I do practice IF to aid in weight loss, but I also tend to feel better in general and I plan to continue past my weight loss goals.

7962,Water only fast for the ENTIRE month of February? Seriously considering it...,"There are 28 days in February and I am considering doing another water only fast. 

I‚Äôve been considering this for awhile now. I was hesitant to say anything because I feel it‚Äôs important that we do (mean) what we say. 

I‚Äôve been going over the reasons as to why I would again, subject myself to an extensive water only fast, especially after saying in one of the videos that ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to do it again‚Äù, I‚Äôve come up with a few reasons (no particular order):

1. The first reason would certainly be because ‚ÄúI CAN DO IT‚Äù. I have done it before and know that I can make it through such an extraordinary feat. There is a level of accomplishment in being able to do something so many others couldn‚Äôt even fathom. 

2. To surpass my old record and actually meet the (original) goal this go round: 30 days. So I would be fasting for 30 days, not just the 28. 30 days was the goal the first time, and I don‚Äôt like not meeting my goals. 28 days of water only fasting is still incredible, and I certainly own that, but I came in 2 days short of my intended goal. 

3. The convenience in timing and luxury of time in being able to take on this venture. In a sense a wise use of time. A time of which I have the opportunity to focus solely on myself and resting. 

4. The health benefits. I like to look at it as the ultimate reset for my body. A complete detox. A period of true and pure rest as the body exerts the energy that was being used in digestion, elsewhere. Some pretty cool (and odd) things happen under the surface when we fast, I like to have that first hand experience of how it impacts the body, all of it. There is a lightness your body begins to feel, and the world itself starts to feel ‚Äúroomier‚Äù as your body shrinks. Overall to experience the physical and mental changes that take place, yes that includes the measurable one (weight loss) but also being able to measure the differences in my heart rate, sleep, among others things that I didn‚Äôt do the first time, the Apple Watch will make all of that tracking super easy and I‚Äôll be able to compare my fasting states to those of when I wasn‚Äôt. 

5. To have fresh, updated perspective to share with the world via my YouTube channel. My fasting videos take the lead in views, and were also created when I was just starting my channel so the videos are very...umm... idk... I didn‚Äôt even know how to edit back then, or obviously make thumbnails, so a lot would improve, as well as, the info I‚Äôd be sharing with the world, including the shitty parts (Bowel movements). 

6. The last time I did this the boys were younger so I was still cooking all of their meals and doing the (single) mom thing. This time the boys are older and I feel it would be an excellent opportunity for Javier to have to fend for himself: groceries, meals, deciding on eating out (with his own money), doing all of his own dishes! The ultimate break for me: No dishes, No cooking, No grocery shopping, No meal planning. So much more time and energy to allow my body to really rest without additional everyday stresses. Imagine how mentally (and physically) time consuming FOOD is. Deciding meals, prepping them, cleaning up after, the cost of it all. Freeing up the mind of having to solve all of that, leaves room/ energy for the mind to do other things. 

7. Another opportunity for me to break (end) the fast in a more healthy manner and implement continued intermittent fasting after. I‚Äôm much more familiar with intermittent fasting so it would be easier to jump right into that after as I‚Äôve been doing in daily for years now. 

8. This internal nudge to do this has been rather persistent, why not listen to it? 

So while I‚Äôm not 100% certain at this point, I am definitely conjuring up reasons to do it, in a sense prepping myself mentally for this possibility. 

I would start this in February as an easy way to track the days, knowing I‚Äôve completed 28 before. I would add the 2 additional days in early March to make it a complete fill 30 days of water only. 

My last long extended fast lasted 1 week, but also consisted of coffee, and teas and was about 5 years ago The 28 days was about 7/8 years ago. 

Doing this is also a representation of self discipline, patience, allowing oneself to really and fully rest and heal from the inside and outside. 

It‚Äôs also really such an incredible thing to experience, all of the changes your body goes through and to watch just how strong/ resilient your body is, equipped with being able to handle the situation, physically and mentally, it requires strength, perseverance.

7969,Please please please eat enough calories!,"I keep reading a lot of posts where people are not eating enough calories during their eating  windows.  You are going to lower your basal metabolic rate (BMR). The goal is fat loss. Smaller fat cells. The scale is not the most important number. Goal weight is not as important as fat percentage. 

Yes if you eat a 500 calorie deficit you will lose weight, but you will also lower your metabolic rate 500 calories or more! If you do this for a year or more and reach you‚Äôre goal weight and then go back to eating those extra 500 calories you will put the weight back on and more! 

From everything I‚Äôve read and researched it‚Äôs better to eat around your metabolic rate in a small time window and incorporate longer water only fasts periodically (24 hrs +). This keeps your BMR stable and you will lose fat. 

For me my BMR is ~1900 calories a day. So I aim for 2000 calories on days I eat. And then I do 36-48 hr water fasts once or twice a month. I‚Äôve lost over 60 lbs and 9% body fat in a year. On days I eat (18:6 or 20:4) I have two big ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô meals around 1000 calories each and very little snacking. 

So please try to eat close to your BMR as possible and do longer fasts for best results! Long term fat loss and maintenance is the name of the game. And wrecking your BMR will make it much more difficult. But if you can eat 1200 calories a day forever then bless your heart! Most of us won‚Äôt ever consistently eat that little.

7970,Peer-review of my IF plan,"Hey guys and gals,

I'm new to intermittent fasting, but somewhat of an intermediate of ketosis (the low carb route)

**short backstory** *During 2020 we moved into our very first house, and at the same time started working from home almost all the time due to Covid-19. We take hour-long walks around the village every other day, and I no longer have the luxury of a lunch buffet at work. So I just eat a few open-faced sandwiches (danish rugbr√∏d for those feeling curious)*

*So I've apparantly lost 5-6 kg during the year, just due to these things..  I want to use this momentum, BUT I don't want to give up weekend fun which includes good food and late snacks.. so I'm trying to incorporate cheat-days and subsequently a recouping day Sunday. This is a bit off of the regular 16/8 beaten path, which is the reasoning behind this post*

- **Monday-Thursday:** *Fast from 20:00-&gt;12:00. (16/8)*
- **Friday:** *Feed from 12:00 to 00:00*
- **Saturday:** *Feed from 12:00 to 00:00*
- **Sunday:** *OMAD day. Sort of. break fast with a piece of fruit 30 min. Before dinner. Dessert allowed. Fast starts at 20:00, continuing into 18/6 Monday*

Calorie count will obviously be larger Friday and Saturday. This is to account for dinner parties, munchies (Friday evenings we often unwind with vaping of cannabis) and general weekend mood.

Which is constant because living at my parents house triggers me. For the time being I've moved back here because there is no one else to take over the mortgage or pay the bills if I move. (Thanks covid) I would really appreciate if anyone out there has any tips for a newbie or if anyone that's just starting out wants to try and do this together please let me know.",intermittentfasting,1610301772
7996,First post here and I‚Äôm not ready to post photos...,"...But I am ready to say that intermittent fasting WORKS. I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúchanged‚Äù my diet but I have lost almost 20 pounds! Right at 17 pounds lost as of this morning! When my eating window opens, I‚Äôm drawn towards healthier foods and fulfilling calories. Carbs don‚Äôt really appeal anymore because I know that I need the best nutrition possible. I‚Äôm living on those flavored sparkling waters, black coffee and plain hot green tea during my fasting periods. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol anymore... just empty calories to me now!! As much as I love the scale victories, seeing my clothes fit loose and my sense of peace around food now- the thing I love MOST is the mental clarity, focus and discipline I am gaining. As a mom with two kiddos I‚Äôm just gonna say that fasting has radically changed my life. I wish I had found this sub sooner!! Xoxo

7998,Is this ok to do it do I need to modify...?,"Hello! So I've beeing doing 18:6 up to 22:2 depending on if I'm home to eat in time (I always stop eating at 7, helps me sleep) for a solid month! I feel pretty good about my self control and I think my relationship with food is healing. I've also lost roughly 8lbs during this time. 

I used to have severe depression and used food to cope, I'd eat literally anything and everything with no portion control. Lots of fast food, lots of sugar. Well, that's changed. 

I calorie count now, I'm supposed to have between 1500-1900 a day, and I've stopped eating sweets for the most part. I can only handle a single fun size candy bar before the sugar makes me sick. 

I've been walking a mile extra a day, doing squats, and a few reps lifting a weight. However, I started going back to the gym!

Now I do 20-45 min of riding a bike and get between 4-8 miles, plus the mile walking the dog. I do hip abduction and I think induction, same motion different muscle groups, 4 reps of 20 each. Then I do several arm machines, and 2-3 ab work outs. I can do 30x of one and 60x of the other. But what ever I do, if I can, I try to do 4 reps of 20. I also go during my fasting period. I try to go to the gym two days on, one day off. It's been a week and a half.

I try to drink at least 20oz of water before I leave, 20oz while I'm there, and then when I get home. Sometimes I'm able to eat right away cause it's in my eating window, sometimes I have to wait maybe an hour at most. I also drink more water through the day, it's just I've made myself drink before, during and after the gym on purpose.

When I do eat, I just eat lunch. I make it high protein, like a chicken sandwich or salmon and something else like rice. I don't eat fast food anymore so they're good quality meat. I also got a food scale to weigh my food so I know how much I'm consuming. I also count butter, oil etc, so there's no surprise over budget calories. 

Sometimes I can't eat enough to reach my calorie intake goal. I'll be anywhere from 50-500 short for that day. Sometimes I can make it within the 50 and then just have like a cookie or something after dinner and be fine. But i get full, and I'm not trying to make myself sick by eating more. I feel fine, even while working out. 

I'm also adding the exercises to my app, and it says to consume more calories. Like all the calories I burn from working out. I thought you're supposed to be in a deficit? 

Things are getting firmer and I can see muscle bulges replacing fat bulges. But my husband's co worker has been telling him, I'm going to hurt myself or end up in the hospital by fasting and working out. Especially the fasting. 

I feel great though. Why could fasting hurt you like she's thinking? Also is this a healthy routine or should I change anything? I'm looking to lose 100-115 lbs. How big should the caloric deficit be? Do I really have to stuff myself to get more calories? I don't eat garbage food much, like maybe once every two weeks. Can anyone give me some advice or tips? Maybe help as to why this lady at my husband's work is so adamant that I'm gonna injury or kill myself? 

I feel so much healthier now, even just in small things. Like it's easier to go up stairs, to walk and not wheeze, my terrible knees don't crack and the really bad one doesn't hurt much anymore.... Am I really hurting myself? Cause I feel like I was hurting myself more eating the way I used to.",intermittentfasting,1611599256
7999,I Need Advice!!,"Hello! I'm new to fasting, but so far I enjoy it and have noticed some weight loss. 

The issue I am having is that I have to take my medications at bedtime, and sometimes taking them on an empty stomach can cause nausea and heartburn. I've read that ""dirty fasting"" allows for under 100 calories during a fast, such as creamer or milk in coffee. Would eating a few crackers or something similar (just enough to settle my stomach when I take my medicine) count as breaking my fast? 

Because of the medications I take, I would have to gradually adjust the time I take them if I wanted to move it earlier in order to line up with my fast. If I have to I can, but it would be tedious, so I wanted to see if there was another option first!",intermittentfasting,1611599081

I've lost 30 lbs and I'm already noticing that my skin is a bit looser, so I'd love to hear the stories of others. Does the skin tighten up over time, or is that something that can really only be fixed with surgery? Is there anything you can to do mitigate warping?

8008,PSA about extended fasts!,"I‚Äôve been doing intermittent fasting for about 7 months now and I have to say it‚Äôs a life saver. I‚Äôve been able to lose around 80 pounds with that + a calorie deficit. It kept me from nighttime snacking and taught me other good eating habits.

However, as you know there‚Äôs always a catch. It‚Äôs very likely you will develop some sort of gallbladder issue if you consistently go on these 24-48 hour fasts. It‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll get gallstones that come with unbearable abdominal and chest pain on random nights. This would go on for months

It got so bad to the point I considered getting my gallbladder removed. But I decided to stop the fasting and all of a sudden I never felt that pain again. I feel so much healthier. I no longer feel weak or dizzy or nauseous.

My mom says it's because I skip breakfast, she says it's really bad for my health but I actually feel better not eating early in the morning.

I've been doing IF on and off for almost 2 years now but have recently been back on track with 18:6 fasts. I think my biggest problem is what to eat when I'm done fasting because I instantly want to eat whatever I'm craving (not in moderation)  and so I haven't seen any major progress. 

I was hoping to get some recommendations or just to hear what most people are eating after a fast/ amount of calories, etc. My fasts are clean- black coffee and water so  I want to make sure I'm nourishing my body and not sabotaging myself once my window opens. Obviously self control plays a role in this but I want to really set myself up for success with some kind of meal structure.

8035,Intermittent fasting and Appendicitis. Are you eating ENOUGH fiber ?,"Been following the 16:8 protocol for almost 8 years and have loved the results it has given me. The peace of mind and great relationship with food is second to none. Low body fat percentage year round? Pff say less ! 

Fiber ? Oh I‚Äôm pretty sure I get plenty of that from those 2 cups of brown rice and the oatmeal in my ‚Äúbreak fast‚Äù shake!

Wrong. 

I write this as I‚Äôm currently in my bed doped up on pain meds. This is day 2 of being released from the hospital.  

At 2am on Friday I was getting rushed to the hospital for an unbearable pain on my lower right abdomen. I thought it was just gas or indigestion initially but the pain wouldn‚Äôt stop.  I reached a point where I couldn‚Äôt even fart even when I felt it brewing inside. 

I get to the ER and the doctors confirm I‚Äôve got an inflamed appendix and need to get it removed ASAP before it ruptures. I would say I got lucky. I was admitted right there and then but didn‚Äôt get surgery until 9:30am. Nurses kept me on morphine to deal with the pain while I waited for the surgeon. It sure made the time pass by. I ask the surgeon what could have caused this and he says sometimes stools can get held up by not eating enough fiber and affect the appendix throughout the process. 

I was home and in bed by 12pm. I‚Äôve been eating bland foods and slowly introducing other foods back. 

I‚Äôm gonna be taking my time to get back into IF but for now , I‚Äôll be treating fiber with the same amount of focus as my other macros. 

If you‚Äôre just now getting into IF or are still a few months in, please please watch your fiber intake. Since you will be consuming larger meals , you may need a larger intake of fiber.

8044,One Cheat Day is okay; but don't act a fool.,"I at least do 16/8 each day. Sometimes I do a full 24 hours, then eat dinner, then go right back into my cycle. Most days are 18.5/5.5.

I love cooking (especially BBQ) and my creativity is at peak levels in the kitchen. 

I decided that having one day out of the week for me to indulge in guilty pleasures keeps me willing to stay with my longterm plan. I use Sunday as my cheat day, but I still fast. Only difference is that I eat whatever I've been craving that week, but in moderation and with a healthy twist. Fried chicken wings with baked brussel sprouts. Or baby back ribs with a side of steamed spinach. I love Mexican food and will be working on a guilty pleasure compromise here too. 

Point being that I'm learning that sacrifices must be made, even with indulgences. I guess the point is to give myself something to look forward to each week -- but not to go too far.

8069,Down 30lbs in 5 months,"Hi All! Happy new year and hope everyone is having fun on their weight loss journey! I‚Äôm posting this as motivation for anyone who is just getting started or struggling with their IF or Keto Journey.

I started my journey back in August 2020. At the height of the pandemic I must admit that I was not at my best. I was depressed and slowly slipping into very destructive behaviour (mostly with alcohol abuse - what else can you do when you‚Äôre stuck at home eh?). 

I decided to take control of my health when I took a look at myself and realized that I had gained a lot of weight - like a LOT (mostly over time but the pandemic did not help at all). I went into full Keto and IF mode and I‚Äôm glad I made that choice. There were a few ‚Äúpauses‚Äù here and there mostly for things like my birthday, my brother‚Äôs wedding as well as Christmas. But it‚Äôs almost end of Jan now and here are my results

28/ M/ 5‚Äô9

SW: 213.6 lbs 28.1% BF

CW: 181.0 lbs 20.8% BF

GW: 160.0 lbs 12.5% BF

I started out by doing 18:6 with IF to get a couple of hours of fat burning. Now I‚Äôm comfortable with doing OMAD (basically 23-24 hours of fasting a day) and that has helped a lot.

I also workout daily - I run about 5-6KM every morning and do atleast 20 minutes of HIIT workout. My aim is to burn around 600-700 calories a day from workouts (thank you Apple Watch competitions for keeping me accountable). 

In terms of food I keep it strictly Keto (mostly veggies and protein) as well as always being in a caloric deficit. Apart from my ‚Äúpauses‚Äù I‚Äôve been pretty consistent (I test my self with a ketone strip every week just to make sure). I haven‚Äôt had much alcohol (or any) since New Years because I know I tend to over do it sometimes, but I am planning on incorporating it back into my life in a healthy way (maybe a glass of wine here and there, little/no beer, whiskey on the rocks as opposed to mixing it with pop etc - I welcome any suggestions from people who have gone through this transition!). 

I was happy to step on the scale this morning after my workout and see I‚Äôm almost back to 170s (I haven‚Äôt seen that number in about 5 years!). I have another week of clean eating before I have my first cheat meal of the month (already got my chicken wings marinating) and then it‚Äôll be back into the grind for February. I still have about 20 ish lbs to go - once I hit my weight goals (hopefully this year) I‚Äôll be posting before and after pictures.

Again - for all those struggling with your journey just remember, you‚Äôre not alone and you GOT THIS. 

TL;DR: lost 30lbs in 5 months with Keto and IF.",intermittentfasting,1611528245

I‚Äôm not new to this... I‚Äôm 44F, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, CW 204... 12 years ago I was a fitness/figure/bodybuilding competitor on the national level. I unexpectedly became pregnant after 7 years of infertility so I stopped, but that, and a follow up pregnancy really messed me up. I gained 60 lbs with the first, then *88* lbs with the second. I had raging out of control gestational diabetes that went undiagnosed, I passed all the tests with flying colors.
The point being I‚Äôm well acquainted with what it takes to lose weight... I was the queen of fasting, counting calories, etc. But ever since these two pregnancies, I have STRUGGLED like you have no idea. I‚Äôm a lifelong lacto ovo vegetarian and often vegan. I eat whole foods, grow most of my own food, blah blah. But weight high, and blood lipids climbing. 

Then my dr diagnosed me with familial hypertryglyceridemia, and put me on fenofibrate to bring lipids down. Right away in 2 months  I lose 16 lbs and then it stops....at 204. Hasn‚Äôt budged. 

Normally I‚Äôve always skipped breakfast and start my mornings with two teas, then have lunch, then a late supper, and a late night snack. 

So 2 months ago I start IF 100% at 16:8, stopping at 7 so no late snacking. After 3 weeks with no change, I up my game to 18:6... two weeks later still nothing. I‚Äôm eating easily 1/2 of what I had been. So then last week I threw in a couple 22 hour fasts, and this week I‚Äôm 19:5..... 

Still 204. 
I did measurements today and NO body composition changes... actually seems to have gone up a bit. I‚Äôve also been doing 45-90 mins yoga NIGHTLY for the last 8 weeks, and I had zero activity before that.

I felt like a genius realizing sparkling water was killing my hunger cravings and thought I would see progress again but alas nothing. I know I am probably being impatient and need to just build good habits but I am struggling. 

While I have started to cook more healthy/keto meals, I break down and snack on carbs and sugar way more than I would like. I also have a drink pretty much every night. Whether it‚Äôs a glass of wine or some scotch. I know alcohol slows the metabolism but I love my evening wind down drink.

I'm trying to ease into it, so I do a 'default' 16:8 schedule. I would want to increase my fasting period eventually, but it is giving me too much discomfort as it is currently, so that from where I am now, I dont know how to get to that point honestly.

At the end of my fast (the last 1-3 hours) and for a while after I've broken my fast, and especially if I've done anything mildly active / that requires focus / is stressful during my fast, I get some symptoms that make it quite uncomfortable to wait out my fast.
The most common one is brain fog... I find it very hard to focus on anything, sometimes literally find it hard to focus my eyes to read text. This can lead to a headache if I try to push through and that in turn (or directly? I don't know) causes nausea. Now I do have (self diagnosed) IBS, so that might have to with all of this as well.

I am so stuck. 

I (30F, 1.70m, 69kg) have been intermittent fasting for a month now (16-8). Only used a frosty on new years day. I work out at least two times a week and cycle to work (20 minutes to and from work).

During my fast I discovered I do a dirty fast (I drink the wrong type of green tea). I drink green tea with nettle, rosemary and ginger. 

I break my fast with two fried eggs on bread, a low carb cracker with hutenkase and avocado and a cracker with chocolate paste. I tend to eat some cookies, chocolate or fruit before dinner and for dinner just your average meal. 

I know people will say I have to count calories. I have done that for over a year and I am sick of it. (And have a pretty good idea what I am getting in my system)

And while that's been great, some days the guilt takes over.

We usually take Friday nights off, to watch a movie and feel free to have some snacks, to eat with friends or have a beer with coworkers. 

Where last week, we ate at friends (keeping distance and all that jazz), but it wasn't a very caloric dense meal. Delicious, but wouldn't even be a cheat day so much if it wasn't for desert and wine. So a cheat day like that is fine, great even.
But yesterday, I had Zoom drinks with my team at work, and then we ordered a burger and fries in from a local place. Amazing taste, but as I logged it... I was appalled by the 1.000+ caloric surplus I reached for that day. 
It really feels like at least 14 days or so of hard work (It still really feels like hard work some days to me) down the drain. Some part of me knows that isn't how this works and if I can get back on track asap it'll be fine.... Right? I don't know. I feel greasy, gross and guilty right now. üòî

Right now i still feel like i have to count calories in those 4 hours and i still feel like i will massively over-eat if i don't count them. The ultimate goal for me is to just have one meal or 2-4 hour eating window and be tuned in to my hunger/fullness cues where i wouldn't NEED to count calories anymore.

I know i need to pay attention to portion sizes to eventually know how much of something is an appropriate amount to eat in one go. I eat very healthy - home-cooked meals, as little processed food as possible, mostly vegetarian with occasional bit of meat. 

TL;DR: waiting for the day when I stop counting calories and be ok with that, knowing that I won't go over my limit. How long did it take you to get to such a point? Any advise, tips or tricks?",intermittentfasting,1622324688

8267,"""You look like you're wearing your daddy's clothes""","This is part advice and part bragging, so bear with me. 

I've been dieting a very long time. I didn't take my health seriously until my daughter was born and I was 350+ pounds. Wife started doing Atkins and I followed--this was back in 2003. I dropped tons initially and got to about 230 at my lowest. Then, stalls, starts, stops and all the usual. Rolled back to about 280 and would sometimes over the years drop 30 here or gain 15 there. As I aged, I naturally eat less, although my appetites are sometimes ridiculous. Started working out with heavy weights in 2019 and dropped weight at first, then added it with muscle. Pandemic hits and I'm out of there. Started running last May and enjoy it. 

Last November me and that daughter, now 18, started IF together. Since then, I've dropped 40 more and am now just (annoyingly) slightly over 200. Doing an average of 19 hours a day this month, and try to get over 20 on weekdays. It's not that hard for me, to be honest.

So during May where I've gained/lost the same 2 pounds all month, I decided to start buying new clothes. My work slacks and shirts are baggy as hell. My sports jackets? Ridiculous. Belts? I am done drilling holes in them.

I didn't want to trash nice suits and jackets, so I took them to the seamstress we use. She had me try them on and told me ""You are like a little boy trying to wear his daddy's jacket!"" They're not alterable to fit me anymore, so I'll be donating them. 

Then, new clothes. I'd been in the XXL range for years, and like loose shirts anyway. Slacks came in best at 34 waist. 34! I've been at f'ng 48 at my heaviest, and hears at 38-40. Got a belt that has no holes so it'll work a while. 

Shirts? I skipped past XL and am wearing larges. I ain't that far from mediums (I'm 5'10""). 

So that weight I didn't lose in May? Partially I realize as I've pushed the running that my legs are getting thicker/larger so that isn't bad weight. Partially I realize that I've had a somewhat radical re-shaping of my body during this period, even when weight is slow to come off.

I have 3, they're silly but they totally help me get my butt off the couch to workout and sticking to 20:4. 

- Food planning! I think about what I'll make,  what's for dinner and snack, how I can involve something new I haven't tried. It's so fun to plan and look forward to 5pm lol

-Music! Anytime I'm reminded or I discover a new song with enough tempo for my workouts it goes on my Spotify workout list and I can only listen then. I'll even switch the radio if a song on my list comes on. I love music but it has to be my reward

-Showers! I don't let myself shower unless it's after a workout. I work from home so I usually take 2 days off a week and I don't shower on those days. And I LOVE my showers 

It takes a lot discipline to get into a good habit but coming up on 1 year into my new lifestyle, nothing else has worked so well or kept me stuck to it for so long. And as good as I feel with my body now,  it really is those 3 things that kept me actually going every day.

But, there is only so much volume I can eat in a meal, and so I wonder about consuming enough protein in just two meals.  In a Jason Fung book I read that the fist meal breaking the fast shouldn't be too big, so that seems to put a lot of pressure on meal 2 to cover a lot of bases.  However, I heard that if you consume too much protein in one sitting, not all of it will be absorbed.  Fung's book also says a 'moderate' amount of protein... what does this mean exactly?

I also drink 1.5-2 gallons of water a day (nursing makes you thirsty). I'm really discouraged I haven't lost any weight. üò©

My pre pregnancy weight was 117. I'm at 140 and it will not budge. I would think my body is trying to hold onto maternal fat stores for breastfeeding but that pisses me off because I breastfed my daughter day and night when she was 9 months old while doing IF and running 60 miles a week while being under 120lbs.

8365,"Went to brewery trivia, didn‚Äôt drink, and it was great","(38F, 5‚Äô4‚Äù, SW 180, GW 120, CW unknown; doing OMAD)

Now that my friends have all gotten the COVID vaccine, we went out to trivia night at a local brewery with a nice outdoor beer garden. This is the first time I‚Äôve actually been out with friends since COVID started.

Craft beer has been a hobby and a social outlet ‚Äî but it also has caused me to gain 30 pounds in 5 years. I just can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to drink so much beer anymore. And since I started OMAD, my alcohol tolerance has tanked anyway. After two beers, I feel sick and then hungover the next day.

So when my friends wanted to hang out at the brewery, I was nervous. Would it be weird if I didn‚Äôt drink? My friends aren‚Äôt the type to hassle/tease me about not drinking, or we wouldn‚Äôt be friends ‚Äî but I still worried that it would feel awkward. Would the brewery even have non-alcoholic beverages? (I‚Äôve been to some breweries where it‚Äôs either beer or little plastic cups of water from a jug.) 

It turns out, they sold cans of soda. So I drank Diet Coke. And it was completely fine. I enjoyed talking with my friends while they drank beer. We didn‚Äôt win trivia, but we had fun trying.

So, I learned that OMAD and avoiding alcohol isn‚Äôt going to mean I can never hang out with my friends when they want to go to the local brewery. It‚Äôs OK if their social scene is still totally craft-beer-centric. I still like the atmosphere of a casual beer garden on a warm evening.

8368,OMAD at 6'4,"Hello hello hello!
Intermittent fasting is not a problem to me, but eating only one meal a day is truly challenging - as if I missed something. I am 6'4 and would face no problem eating carbo rich food and sugar with 2-2.5k kcal per meal - eating decent food, low on carbs on the other hand is a big challenge. Of course I could just not do OMAD, but I wonder how other people handle it. What do you eat and what portion sizes? Do you really eat 2500 kcal worth of steak and veggies at once? Even if I dropped half the potatoes in a gratin, eating (more than) 2000 calories would be a challenge - the large volume would probably kill me for a period of time.

So - how do you handle it? What do you eat?",intermittentfasting,1622199922
8370,Not losing weight 16:8,"Hello,

I started intermittent fasting just over a week ago. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 132 lbs. my usual is around 125 lbs and I wanted to lose it via IF. 

I despise counting calories so I thought IF would be ideal as long as I‚Äôm mindful of how much I‚Äôm eating. I am plant-based and a lot of my meals are pure veggies so i have a hard time imagining I am overeating.

I strength train 3x week and do high intensity cardio 2x week. 

I‚Äôve also started hormonal birth control last November and wonder if that is affecting the rate at which I‚Äôm seeing weight loss. Am I just not being patient enough? Has anyone else experienced this?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

8372,Upset stomach in the mornings,"Happy Friday all. Apologies if this isn't quite an appropriate question for the sub, I did a bit of googling and my research was inconclusive. Essentially I started IF 16:8 last Sunday for its numerous health benefits but also to give me some discipline in my life which I think has been lacking for the last few years. My plan of the day generally is wake up around 5:15, hit the gym, come back and start my eating window until just after midday. Start fasting and then sleep around 10/11pm then repeat. It has been going surprisingly well and not difficult to maintain (granted it's only been a week) but the last couple of mornings, when I woke up, I have had an upset stomach. I'm drinking \~2 litres of water during the day so peeing plenty and i'm not going/needing to go to the toilet during the day, but the mornings are not that pleasant.

8374,No gain or fluctuations after stopping!?,"So I did IF 16:8 for about a week. 3 of those days were basically keto the rest just lower carb. I dropped 8lbs as far as the scale was concerned.

The thing is, the scale hasn‚Äôt gone back up at all, and I‚Äôve honestly eaten pretty badly. No ups or down really either. Is that weird? Regardless, I‚Äôm starting again today, and hopefully I‚Äôll pull my 290 down to my goal 180 one day!!

But I definitely blew my carb limit, despite my best efforts!

My dinner was a braeburn apple at home because I was ever so slightly hungry and fancied something fresh and tangy, unlike the multitude of sausages and salami and cheese I tried today. And the eating window has slammed shut again!

Last year it was delayed because of COVID, and then by the time they held it I didn't have a kitchen (we were doing renovations) so it would have made me sad. I'm delighted that I went today, and I'm not going to 'make up for it' by fasting longer tomorrow, or restricting calories more.

8380,"NSV: I'm in there somewhere. Finding myself through hobbies, interests, etc.","I have a new ritual. Instead of letting the stress of life get chomped into little pieces in the form of snacks up until bedtime, I've recently started recognizing my ""vulnerable times"" and letting my hobbies take the reins. It's been years since I've finished or read a book at all, but in the last month I have gone to lay in bed a couple hours early with a novel or a comic book and have a stack next to my bed that is being slowly whittled away. Or, I will put my headphones on and dive into painting. These are things I never thought I had time for. After all, I'd work till 5, come home, cook dinner, clean the kitchen, take care of the animals, and have just enough time to shower and fall asleep after maybe an hour of staring at facebook and living vicariously through the lives of others. 

It feels so good to do what I love again. No more coming home to cook. I get to sit and watch a movie with my partner, or play with the dog, or anything I want because there are so many more things to do than eat. 

The cravings test me at every turn, and all I want to do is shove crap in my face, but slowly realizing that my fat is giving me serious body dysphoria, and that I really am in there, somewhere, and I have more time to be me has helped. I no longer can eat my past, my emotions, my traumas, and am forcing myself to find the oueces that I lost by doing the things I love. I falter of course. Some days I eat.... everything in sight.

8394,M/40/5'9 from 205lb to 175lb unintentionally,"Hi, I hope it's ok to just make a kind of vent post talking about some of my experiences and thoughts. This will probably be kind of long and rambling, the TL;DR I guess is that I got busy at work during the pandemic last year and started missing dinner which eventually evolved into OMAD and me losing 20 lbs before I'd even realized I was losing weight.

Quick background: skinny kid until I hit drinking age, 12-pack a day for a years in my early 20's and I was at 185 by the time I was 25. It seemed like every few years I'd add another 5 pounds until the heaviest I saw on a scale was 207. Tried to drink less calories, started filling a water bottle and drinking less soda but never tried dieting.

I had been skipping breakfast for a few years probably, not sure exactly when I started but it was a gradual thing I think. Nowadays though I never eat breakfast on weekdays, although I do eat a few left over bites of the sausage patty or fruit I make for my son and take a sip of my wifes coffee so I can carry it to her without spilling it. I eat one large meal of protein and carb with a dessert around 2pm in the afternoon. I get home from work around 9pm and drink 1-5 sugar-free seltzers before bed. If I am in bed before 1am then I never have any trouble, if it's after 1 and I'm closer to that 5th drink than the 1st then I might eat half a bag of chips and half a tub of ice cream but even then I feel like I'm still consuming less calories than if I had 3 regular meals a day. It's been great because I don't have any pressure on me, I didn't start with a goal and don't feel bad if I decide that I would rather eat something then fast overnight. I know that if I was stricter and trying harder I could probably achieve ketosis and lose weight faster by eating healthier and sticking to stricter fasting and cutting out sugar, carbs, and alcohol, but this way I never beat myself up if I don't want to suffer and empty stomach. And by the way, it's not really suffering. After months of doing this I don't really have growls or hunger pangs. One of the interesting ideas that I found while learning about some of this stuff is that we train our bodies to prepare themselves for food at certain times of the day. You stomach growls and starts making enzymes around lunchtime because you have trained your body to expect food at that time everyday. And now that I have been thinking about it and living it I have definitely noticed that I have retrained my stomach and that it hardly ever growls and gets acidy anymore. People think that there stomach is telling them that they need to eat, but it is actually just a pavlovian response to the time of day. I feel like this is a huge thing that could help a lot of people be healthier by just understanding their bodies a little better.

Since I have lost weight I have had significant improvement in some areas of my health. Over the last 2 years I had felt like I was developing plantar fascitis. I had bad pain in the arch of my feet in the mornings. Since my weight loss it has completely disappeared. I also no longer suffer from any routine indigestion, I used to eat tums at least once a week and now can't remember the last time I needed one. There's the obvious stuff too, I can last a bit longer in bed, feel light on my feet, my titties jiggle less when I jump. It was amazing how this has helped with the inflammatory stuff though, have seen studies that say Keto can help with inflammation so I was intrigued how much of it was just the weight loss and if any extra health benefits were coming from the micro-ketos I presumably get during longer fasting.

I had said for a long time that I didn't care for eating food, like If I could just take a pill or drink a nutrient shake for the day I would do that most days. It would seem now that I wasn't just bullshitting and that I really can live with much less food in my life. It has been so easy for me, like the post title says it was practically unintentional. I'm just not one to go around preaching to people so I haven't talked about this stuff to people and just wanted to talk out some of these things I'd been thinking of. People have noticed my weight loss, at least 10 people between my family and co-workers have commented on it unprompted, and I have talked a little about how it happened but I really feel like I stumbled on to something so easy and effective but it seems like such a paradigm shift when you try to talk to people about it that I never try to push people towards it. Like 3 meals a day is just normal, it's what 99% of people have done their whole lives, trying to change that normal is like trying to reinvent the wheel. No one wants to think that they've been eating wrong their whole lives I guess.

I haven't noticed any blood sugar problems, no mood swings or headaches or sluggishness or anything. This is the only concession I can think to make, it may be physiologically more difficult for some people to fast. But really I just feel like people don't realize how effective the ""eat less"" advice is. My wife has had a goal for the last 2 years to workout at least 30 minutes a day during the weekdays, and she has done it. It's great and I'm really proud of her, she's healthier and feels better, but she has barely lost any weight because of it. Whereas I am down 30 pounds without ever breaking a sweat. Calories in is the secret, and it's super easy to stay below your daily caloric needs when you only eat one meal. Like I could have a giant plate full of 2000 calories of food and I would probably still be at a caloric deficit for that day even after 400 calories of alcohol that night. I know that as a healthy male I have it easier than some people, but I still drink a Coke with my midday meal and usually have a slice of red velvet cake with it. I eat fast food and meat and cheese and pasta and rice. I and not restricted to rabbit food or bland tasteless stuff. I can eat whatever I want. I also look forward to my meal more, it seems more filling and satisfying before. And I don't have to plan my whole days around meals, what to eat when, I don't have to take the extra time to prepare food and eat it and sit there lethargically afterwards. 

So that's most of what I had been thinking. I just feel like everyone should be doing this. You can eat whatever you want, feel better, and maintain a healthy weight if you just skip a few meals during the week. On the weekend I eat 2 meals a day and sometimes have a dessert that night, breakfast around 11am and dinner around 6pm. I never feel like I am suffering or ""starving"". If I'm really hungry then I eat, but usually if I ignore it for 15 minutes then the feeling goes away. Another thing that I had heard is that when you are bored or your brain is unoccupied for a while you with cycle through your hierarchy of needs. So if you're bored then you brain goes ""Maybe you're hungry, you should eat. Maybe you're tired, you should sleep. Maybe you're horny, you should perform ungodly acts upon yourself..."" and this can lead to bad behaviors. You don't need to eat, you're just bored. I am lucky that I've never been a big snacker, but I am also aware that sometimes when I get up and start looking in the cabinet I don't actually want or need food, I'm just bored, and this often helps me just go sit back down without eating something.

8412,Exhaustion and soreness on OMAD,"35/f/sw 221 cw 194.4

I transition to OMAD from 18/6 last Friday. So far I love it. It's simple, I don't have to obsess about food, and I've enjoyed preparing one really nice meal using whole foods every night. I break my fast with some nuts. I drink one cup of coffee in the morning and drink plain water the rest of the day. I love this lifestyle.

The last couple of days I have been experiencing an abnormal amount of exhaustion. I have not been exerting myself any more than usual (leisurely walks, playing with my kid, light housework, slow pace on exercise bike). I have a hard time getting out of bed and feel fuzzy-sleepy for awhile after waking. I even have trouble getting out of bed to use the bathroom at night.  I feel weighed down physically and mentally. I've been getting 8ish hrs of sleep a night (my usual) and have not been abnormally restless (according to fit bit and my husband).

I'm also just sore and achy. I feel like the day after a week long camping trip. I feel like I've been hit by a bus.

 I have been regularly drinking water (about 80-100oz a day). My pee looks ok, so I don't think I'm dehydrated, but my mouth is kind of dry and sore. I've heard dry mouth is common with IF, but I wasn't sure.

If this is a normal part of transitioning to OMAD, I'd like to stick with it. However, if this is unusual, I will go back to 18/6 or even 16/8.

8427,20:4 and OMAD is so much easier after doing a 2.5 day fast!,"I just, as of yesterday, completed my first short extended fast over 36 hours. I felt I really needed a kickstarter to get back into my routine of fasting and chose a 2-3 day fast to reset my mentality and to see how much it just might affect my body composition/bloating/etc).  Wow. So here is a quick summary of my experience (I'll keep it brief).  


**Day 1**

I have done many 20-24 hour fasts, so Day 1 was no big deal. Mentally, though, going to bed was a little difficult knowing that I had skipped dinner and would be moving on past 24 hours. I would agree that I felt more mentally alert after 20 hours. 

Sleep was fine, nothing notable really. No workout today. as I had lifted heavy the day before.

**Day 2**

Black coffee (I DID decide to allow coffee this time, maybe I won't next time) but only one cup. Weird. I feel quite energized and woke up earlier than usual without feeling the need to crawl back in bed and snooze. Mentally clear most all of the day. No real hunger pangs though a few odd cravings (mental only) later in the day. 

Today I worked out, lifted pretty heavy for almost an hour, in the late afternoon. Felt really good and had plenty of energy until the last quarter of the workout where I was feeling a little drained. Felt weird not to take any of my normal supplements before or after or eat or drink anything but water after, but no real issues. 

Felt mentally stimulated until about 7 pm which is later than normal for me. I DID however have some moderate light headedness from about 5:30pm until bedtime. Salted some water and drank up. Went to bed around 9 with no hunger pangs and feeling lighter and leaner (or was I imagining it). 

**Day 3**

Black coffee again and feeling zero desire for food and head feeling very, very clear. Lightheaded ness was gone (also went to grab some trace mineral electrolytes and used these in my water and coffee along with some sodium). Honestly felt incredible and wondered why I even needed to stop my fast. Considered pushing past 3pm and going for a 4th day but decided to save that for my next time. Honestly though, third day was easily the easiest. 

Felt very lean and looked leaner in the midsection and in my face. I was down about 6 lbs. Some water/bloat, yes, but considering my electrolyte and sodium water intake it was definitely some fat as well. No workout today. 

Broke fast with some homemade bone broth and later had a fairly normal sized (if not large) dinner. Salad, grilled corn, a few smoked chicken wings and a sushi roll (don't judge, it was $5 Wednesdays at the sushi counter while I was grabbing the grill fixings). No acid reflux but after the broth, I had a lot of gurgling and later visited the restroom for obvious post-extended fast reasons.

**Day 4**

Black coffee. Back to a 20:4-ish schedule. Seems like NOTHING mentally and seems even a bit weird to only fast for 20 hours now. Totally odd how the mental shift happened. When you go without food for over 48 hours you realize that you like to eat, and can, but really don't need to. Not at all. At least...not nearly as often as you normally do. 

**Going forward**

I'll be incorporating 48-72 hour fasts once a month, or at least once a quarter from now on. It felt really, really good. I felt leaner, looked leaner, had incredible mental clarity, felt better digestively and overall enjoyed it. I did, however, enjoy the ritual of eating again, so balance is (as always) the key to success.",intermittentfasting,1622126674

8445,Is large calorie deficit dangerous when fasting? I cannot eat enough in my feast window.,"Hi folks, I need advice on this unclear matter. I read the Obesity Code and basically it says if you put less calories in your body, your metabolic rate slows down over time, as your body gets adjusted for reduced food intake coming in.

So now my problem is that I fast 20:4 (F/43 SW: 75kg GW: 65kg) and I also daily exercise and my calorie burn is around 2500 kcal/day, but I am unable to eat so many calories in my window unless I force it down my throat or eat some high calorie junk food. I usually manage 1600 kcal, which is 900kcal deficit daily. I do not fast over the weekend.

Is this somehow not good? I am worried that I will have this yoyo efect related to reducing kcal.

8446,"Weight loss has plateaued since I have gone back to the gym, any advice on getting out of the plateau?","Title says it all really.

Started If (16:8) last November when my area went into a hard lock down. I managed to loose 13kg over 4 months. However since the gyms have re-opened (about a month and a half) I have been going religiously. At the gym I almost exclusively lift weights (1 to 2 hour sessions). I do a 5 to 12k run on non gym days for cardio and a 4 hour mtb session on Sundays. My normal weeks are: Mon, wed, Fri; at  the gym. Tue, Thurs; run. Saturday; rest Sunday; mtb

With my diet I try to eat high veg/fruit, high protein, some carb and low fat.

I have been hovering around the 96kg mark since the gyms have re opened. I can't seem to get below this number not matter how much exercise and how good I am with my diet.

I've been doing 18/6 otherwise without to much trouble. Today though, I got peer pressured into a bagel half by my preschooler. And then yep, hours later, you guessed it, realized it was that time of the month. (Normally preschooler peer pressure, and bagels, are not too hard to resist.)

ANYWAY- I was walking past a mirror the other day, and stopped in my tracks. Where did my butt go? I mean it‚Äôs still big, yes, but it used to really stick out. Like laying on my back hurt because of how much it stuck out. Lately I‚Äôve noticed yoga poses on my back didn‚Äôt hurt like they used to as well but I just thought my body was getting used to it.

8483,Just realizing how big of a part mindfulness has in fasting.,"I (25/M/5'11) was a fairly active and fit fellow that's been fasting on and off since discovering IF a few years ago. But nothing serious, have only been using it as a tool to maintain weight. 


Last year, when the pandemic hit, around March 2020, I stopped exercising and eating well. My life hasn't been going good for years and my depression decided to switch into HARD mode, where I would regulate it by excessively eating and deliberately not exercising. I kept this self-destructive streak up until April of this year, over the course of which I went from 72 kgs to 87 kgs. 15 kilos over my healthy weight.


I sat back and watched as my body morphed into this..thing that I resented, simultaneously fueling it with just crap crap crap food. It's also funny cuz I struggle severely with body dysmorphia, and my self esteem is heavily tied to the way I look and feel in my skin. It's the reason why I used to put effort into staying in a moderately healthy shape. But something in my clicked, and I just surrendered to the pain and stopped caring. I think it may have to do with not having control or autonomy over my life, and this was some sick demented way of me exercising control (???)


I've now, for the past month or so, stopped, and have decided to get back on the wagon, and so I'm slowly; stretching, working on my posture, building up my cardio, slowly introducing strength training, trying to eat moderately, and fasting on and off - mostly by not eating after 4 in the evening and just having breakfast the next day without tracking the hours. 


It's been quite a ride so far, my brain actively fights me and wants me to revert to my old habits. The frequency at which my brain throws these requests have reduced though, and I'm slowly able to let them fade away, and treat them just as noise and not what I truly want. But it's a struggle, it takes so much mindfulness on my part to stay on track. Sometimes I switch into autopilot mode where I find myself walking to the kitchen, trying to rationalize with myself that a little bit won't hurt.....it takes work, a lot of self-reflection and mindfulness to stop. 


At this very moment, I'm a few hours into the night since my last meal, and I almost caved in and grabbed a can of pringles to indulge in. But to my surprise, I found it easier to say no and walked away. Hoping in time, through discipline and mindfulness, I can get on a strict fasting regimen -- possibly 6-7 months of consistent 16:8 -- and drop 15 kgs of body weight and fit into my clothes again.


Having this community has been such a blessing, and it genuinely, genuinely helps to know that around the world there are people fasting with me, and that keeps me going and motivated.

For the past couple of weeks I've been tracking my calories and meal planning to eat healthier foods. I started IF 18-6 Sunday and because I wasn't hungry and because I'm eating mostly vegetables and meats I'm finding it very hard to reach my calories goals everyday. 

On top of that, yesterday (Tuesday) about 3 hours before the end of my fast I began to feel physically shaky. My body was in ketosis but I feel like I maybe my blood sugar was low as well. I decided to break the fast immediately with some almonds as I was at work and needed to be able to function. I felt a little better after that.

8544,22/Jan to 15/Mar OMAD no specific measurements or weight but I just got a super boost in will to continue.,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster.
I decided to start OMAD in January in order to drop weight. I've been a bit chonky all my life, kinda borderline overweight, sometimes more and sometimes less.

I kept seeing posts in which people lost so much weight and that was always an inspiration, but I never saw too many results in me while doing it.
Today, a few minutes ago I got super excited because I tried to wear a pair of pants (airsoft pants)  to see if there was any difference and I am absolutely astonished.

These pants in particular used to be really tight, sort of a chore to wear. They were really tight on my thighs and I could never buckle them therefore I had to walk around with the top button loose (using a belt to keep them on my waist.

As soon as I put them on, I shrugged but noticed they were a bit loose on my thighs, but I audibly gasped when I buckled the final button.
I successfully wore them and they are not at all as tight as they used to be. I just got such a big surge of motivation to go on and lose even more weight!

Besides this major step there have been only a few more minor things I noticed:

-More definition and less fat on my shins, they used to be fatter but now I can clearly see the muscle outlines.

-Loose belly fat. It used to be ""solid"" so to say but now it's loose and bouncier.

-I feel less fatigue

-Finally broke my pushup limits, I can now do 25 in a row or three sets of 10-15.

-My blood pressure lowered, I measured it recently and my mother even commented on it.

-Some of my friends told me I looked slightly thinner


To answer a few questions about diet:

I eat only once a day, usually at 19:00. I wake up from 08:00 to 11:00 and I go to sleep between 23:00 and 02:00.

My meals consist mostly of meats and fats. I usually eat meat with either vegetables, rice or cheese. Sometimes nuts, and sometimes fruit. During the first month of OMAD I used to eat junk food (pizza and chips, mostly) but I decided to cut them out.

I drink a lot of water, a lot of tea and a lot of coffee. (I sometimes drop a teaspoon of butter inside my coffee, first cup only) Not always. I heard it can break the fast but not ketosis.

I exercise sometimes, usually every other day. Home based strenght training. Pushups, crunches, HIIT sets, dumbbells. Sometimes skipping rope and sometimes biking. I try not to sweat too much to avoid showering everyday. 
I exercise mid afrernoon, usually 4-5 hours before my meal.

I'm 5'8 or 173cm (I think), and I was around 85 to 95kg, with some muscle mass due to previous gym experience. Can't remember the BF% nor the visceral fat but I'm gonna guess around 22 to 25%.

I haven't weighted nor myself lately but as soon as I get a new battery for my scale, I think I will.

The act of successfully putting on these pants might not seem like much but for me it is a huge step and it's progresa that I've never seen before. It gave me a huge boost to keep going.

If you got this far, thanks for reading. Feel free to ask any questions, comment or talk about your progress. And most importantly, keep going! We're all losers here :)",intermittentfasting,1615853973

**The First Attempt: Headaches**

I initially tried 16:8 and 18:6 fasting, but suffered from headaches and occasional lightheadedness, which, looking back, we're due to dehydration. After a few weeks of 16:8 and 18:6 I gave up because of the headaches and lightheadedness.

**The Second Attempt: Lack of Progress**

Several months later, I bought some electrolyte packets with 1000mg of salt, and tried again. The salt-heavy electrolytes resolved the headaches and light-headedness, and I quickly advanced from 16:8 to 18:6 and eventually 20:4 fasts over a few weeks. Unfortunately, I was losing virtually no weight, so I stopped again. 

**The Third Attempt: 23:1 / OMAD**

Looking back at my second attempt, I realized that I was so hungry after fasting, that the \~2 meals I would eat within \~4 hours would roughly equal the calories I would eat on a regular day. The duration of the fasts wasn't really a problem though, especially with the electrolytes, so I figured I should just try 23:1 / OMAD and see if that worked better.

I've been doing 23:1 / OMAD about 5 days a week for the past 2 weeks (reverting to 16:8 on the weekends). So far, I've lost about 12 lbs, and I'm making steady progress towards my goal weight.

I'll stick with this as long as I have momentum, but I'm considering exploring some other similar styles of fasting, such as alternating day.

In addition to enjoying the progress, I really like the simplicity of OMAD. For me, I find it makes it much easier to stick to.

Wish me luck as I try to get from \~221 lbs down to 199 (and beyond)!",intermittentfasting,1615838970

What if our thinking about hunger is all wrong?  What if hunger is not some ""bad"" thing that needs to be extinguished with food, but instead it is a good thing? 

To clarify, I'm talking about the feeling of hunger, not actual starvation which of course would be bad.

I will experiment with embracing hunger by:

\- using intermittent fasting for 12 hours at night (eliminate nighttime snacking)

\- use visualizations to help view the feeling of hunger as a positive thing, not negative. 

Visualizations: Visualize the following 

(not science based at all, just a way to view the hunger in a positive light)

1. Hunger is like a fire in your belly that should be controlled with food,  but not extinguished completely.

2. If weight loss is the goal, then try to view bodyfat as the ideal fuel source to feed the hunger ""fire"" - view the fire in your belly as literally burning fat away.

I have been in good shape for most of my life and up until the last year, I found it very easy to lose weight when I needed to.

I‚Äôve lived with depression and anxiety for most of my life and usually my diet would be the first indicator. I‚Äôd lose a lot of weight and I was a skeletal 108 lbs about seven years ago. Once I got my mental health in order, I gained weight and worked out and looked good. But suddenly, the weight started creeping up. I successfully balanced my weight and working out in 2017. I liked the way I looked for the first time in my life (photos show me that I always had a slightly off view of myself but 2017 was the first time I was happy with what had already been there). I realized also that I‚Äôd been doing IF before I even knew what it was. I‚Äôm very much an ‚Äúeat when you‚Äôre hungry‚Äù kind of person. During 2020, like most people, the weight started creeping up and I‚Äôm currently the heaviest I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm working out more than I ever have in my life and started doing IF again more deliberately and I‚Äôve only lost about 2lbs. I‚Äôm nervous to even get on the scale because I‚Äôve gained and lost those same two pounds since December.  I‚Äôve never been self conscious about my weight but along with some other health problems, it‚Äôs starting to affect my life. I don‚Äôt like to zoom. I have a public facing career and have missed opportunities because I don‚Äôt want to be on camera right now. 

Health wise: I was hospitalized twice for severe anemia and was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that has caused my hair to follow out.

I‚Äôm also getting weekly iron infusions to help with the anemia. Current bloodwork looks really good.

I am more patient.  Having lost a lot of weight in the past few months, I move better, so I feel like I can devote more time and energy to things, and, quite frankly, I am not always looking for a place to sit down, and this has a major effect on how I interact with other people and the world in general.

8610,"Okay, I'm finally starting this. 38m, 5'8"" height, SW 216lbs, GW 160lbs. Looking for advice.","So before the pandemic (dec 2019 and earlier) I usually floated around 185lbs due to work and lifestyle, a little overweight but not bad I felt. I worked in Hospitality (hotel, bar, wedding/events) so I worked hard, ate rich and drank like someone else was buying. I quit my job in Nov 2019, moved to Idaho to be with friends and the pandemic happened so I lost my job and I've been riding unemployment since (though it took almost 6 months for the first check so I got really depressed as I emptied my savings and had to borrow money). 

I got most of my stressors out, I eat healthy and float about 1800 calories a day but after losing 10 lbs I've plateau'd at 215lbs for 2 months even though I've upped my activity level. I got an oculus quest 2 headset and I play movement games and exercise games at least 2 hours a day, 5 days a week (a long with playing with the dogs, and jumping on the exercise bike occasionally). 

I've come to the conclusion in my middle years I'm not going to rebound as easily as I did in my 20s, so I'm looking for advice to help me be more successful. 

The good about my situation:

1. I can cook well and track calories easily. Lots of raw and steamed veggies, lean meat and not going heavy on the carbs. I cook a variety for myself and my roommates (who are dieting as well, mostly paleo) so we aren't bored of food. I can keep to a 1500 calorie meal plan easily.

2. Activity doesn't bother me (but I get bored hence why I got into vr to trick myself into moving). No major health concerns, just kinda lazy as work was my primary source of activity. 

The bad:

1. I'm a smoker (djarum blacks, 12 per pack, usually a pack a day), its habit and while I'm reducing it, I don't think I'll kick it soon.

2. I like my alcohol. 15 years of having a night cap (rarely more than 3 ""drinks"" worth a night, typically between 2 beverages). More often straight whiskey I sip on than beer.

3. I hate tea. I can drink black coffee just fine but tea is just foul to me.

4. I've turned into a full night owl due to being unemployed.

5. I won't give up carbs because I'm filipino and I get rice cravings. So no paleo or keto for me.

6. Most of my weight is around my belly and its the visceral belly fat, so I'm not a soft belly and it seems hard to drop it. 

7. I'm probably depressed and I definitely get anxiety, the main reason I had to quit my previous job as the stress just saturated my every waking moment.

And some questions about doing a 16:8 plan

1. I know that diet soda drinks are no good, but are water flavors okay? Like Mio? Or should I avoid those too during the fasting times?

2. I'm thinking about doing a 2pm-10pm eating time, as I usually go to sleep around 2am. I know i should give 4 hours between last eating and sleeping, I typically will play an easy activity game like BeatSaber or Until You Fall for an hour during that time, with something like Supernatural in the afternoon (exercise game, gets a decent sweat on). Does this seem okay? Honestly I'm currently planing it like this so I can drink whiskey from 9pm to 10pm.

3. Is there any particular foods that I should avoid to not screw up the intermittent fasting? I feel like with my luck I'll eat the one thing you shouldn't eat. 

4. How should ""cheat days"" work to be in my favor? I've heard that you should have a cheat day so your body doesn't get too used to the routine or something like that? Obviously don't eat junk food as a primary calorie source but any tips on it?

5. Any tips for a middle aged nerd in general?

8614,"First time doing any kind of dieting + exercise (with Ring Fit Adventure), what do you think of my plan?","First time at this subreddit, I'm 23F, current weight 143 lbs and target is 120 lbs.

I decided to get Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure to increase my activity level from ""non-existent"" due to Covid lockdown, when things were normal I was still very much not active but at least I walked around hours on end several times a month with shopping, and also doing archery which I can't do now due to ranges being closed. I thought while I get myself moving again, I'd give weight loss a go too.

I thought I'd try intermittent fasting because I feel I'm already half way there with fully implementing it in my lifestyle - my laziness of waking up at around 10am, no big appetite for breakfast and imposed ban on snacking after 8pm by parents since teenage years because ""it's bad for you"" (their words, not mine) has already kind of set my 8/16 eating window of 11am-7pm and sticking with it about 80% of the time. I just need to put in more effort so that goes to 100%. 

I won't count calories just yet since my main motive is to get into a more active lifestyle than I am now before officially focussing on weight loss, but going by the fact that over one year of being sedentary I gained only about 2-3 kg, I'm hoping that however much I'm eating is not much above my resting metabolic rate, so exercise might be the push I need to kickstart my weight loss journey. I'll start watching calories once either I start losing weight and reach a plateau, or I don't see any difference in myself after a while.

I've posted a similar content on r/RingFitAdventure, and got some useful feedback regarding the Ring Fit part. But most of what I can find there focusses on the more traditional restrictive dieting, so I'm hoping whether you can give me some feedback with a intermittent fasting person's point of view.

I posted the below in r/depressionregimens as I had a really unexpected response to 2 days of OMAD. In short, a long term depression suddenly lifted - at least temporarily. (It's still gone and I am now ready to start my second stint of 5 days OMAD after 2 days off.)

Basically, I was met with a lot of negativity. Two aspects were raised: 1) OMAD was dangerous and I shouldn't post something that might lead people people to try it, 2) the mental benefits would be short-lived and addictive.

What is your take on it, as I assume many here have lived with OMAD or similar schedules for longer periods of time? Thanks in advance!

Original post in r/depressionregimens:
---------------

 Short background: I have been suffering from depression for at least 20 years, mixed with some anxiety. I have never medicated, but tried all forms of therapy, as well as various natural supplements and other substances (hemp oil for example). I have exercised, meditated etc. etc.

Recently with the Corona situation and working exclusively from home, I gained a few unwanted pounds. So, without changing anything else, I started fasting. Specifically, I eat only one meal a day (dinner). After just two days I noticed something very unexpected: My mood was much better than normal, and my focus was improved. Anxiety was non-existent.

Granted, I have not been fasting for long (now five days in total), but the lift in mood is unlike anything I have ever experienced during the last 20 years. I was not expecting it at all, and have just started reading up on the scientific studies done on fasting and mood. There are not many, and those that exist are conflicting; some experience worse mood, and some an extreme improvement. It is believed to be dependent on genetic makeup, the cause of depression in the individual case, and the type of fasting (where the more extreme variants were better than the more careful).

If you are in normal or good health, are of normal or above normal weight, and suffer from mood problems, I can only recommend giving it a try. Eat just once a day for a week and see what happens. I am extremely curious to see if this is a lasting effect (according to studies it commonly is). It would be amazing if my long bout of depression simply stems from the gut and body working to digest glucose most of the day is the cause of my troubles.

Anyway, I hope this can help someone!

One study and an article, fwiw: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4790398/ https://www.psychcongress.com/article/can-intermittent-fasting-help-treat-depression

Edit to comment: This post stirred up a lot of discussions based on a stance that my proposal above may be dangerous. The danger would be based in 1. fasting being dangerous in itself due to changes in physiology, 2). fasting potentially leading to eating disorders, especially in sensitive people.

My reply to this has been as follows:
Regarding #1 (physiological dangers) this is not really supported by the studies. There are some individuals who respond negatively, but overall the effects of intermittent fasting is positive. Lower insulin levels and sensitivity, lower blood pressure, weight loss, etc. Also, I am not planning to continue without breaks. Currently I do 5 days on and 2 off (where I eat whatever I want as normal). Later I will likely fast fewer days just to maintain weight and healthy insulin function.

Regarding #2, yes some may probably have a problem if they have an unhealthy relationship with food. I maintain that the danger of this has to be put into context. ALL potential remedies for depression have their associated dangers:

Psych meds? Potentially life threatening side effects and dependence.

Electro shock? Memory problems and cognitive problems.

Meditation? Some people report worsening symptoms.

Therapy? Some people report worsening symptoms (applies to all forms of therapy).

Ketamine/esketamine? Some people have really bad ""trips"", some suffer flashbacks repeatedly.

Psilocybin? Bad trips, flashbacks.

I can go on. So, Intermittent Fasting: Is it perfectly safe for everyone? No. Is it safer than many of the options above? Yes.

Ultimately everyone has to take responsibility for their situation and their life. The above has been my experience and I shared it here as I felt a duty to do so. If I experienced an extreme lift in mood due to giving my body a break from insulin spikes, then perhaps someone else can benefit. I really wish someone would have told me this 20 years ago. Who knows how my life may have been then.",intermittentfasting,1615736820

I've lost about 85 lbs since last July, but I really kicked things into gear in November and I've lost about 65 of those lbs since then. I've been resistance training and fasting a ton and have added a notable amount of muscle to the body.

The first nice non-scale gain is that I dropped a couple of t-shirt sizes and my mom saw me and said ""your arms and forearms are bigger"", which is true and it's nice that it's not just me that noticed!

The other nice non-scale gain is today my daughter was visiting. She's incredibly supportive of anything I want to do and always has my back (as I try to do for her) and has been cheering me on on this journey. She was giving me a hug goodbye and pulled back and said ""Wow - you *are* a skinny minny!""

8671,"My first day of intermittent fasting, now: 100KG last year: 87KG","Yeah... its getting out of control. I decided to join intermittent fasting after watching so many videos by Dr. Berg.

The reason I chose to follow this lifestyle is that I have been intermittent fasting inefficiently for years so I might as well just do it correctly.

My daily habit was waking up, drinking a coffee and not having breakfast, having my first meal around 2pm and another somewhat big meal around 5pm or 6pm, or sometimes I would skip breakfast entireky and have a decent lunch around 5pm. 

My biggest problem was confusion, I thought it was healthy to get your full calorie intake per day or your body will enter starvation mode, so I resorted to late night snacking, which is a slippery slope, because during the night my appetite seems to only go up while I eat.

Its still my first day, I'm currently on an 18 hour fast with no signs of hunger yet, last night was pretty challenging since I usually am used to falling asleep to falling asleep with a full stomach. Yesterday night I couldn't fall asleep until 5am. 

I really like this diet because it elemenates my stress of feeling like I must eat, and then end up over eating.  

Its still my first day so clearly I haven't seen benefits except one very important one: I woke up feeling proud I did not cave in yesterday and I'm surprisingly less grouchy than every day.

8703,Unexpected side effect of weight loss: STINKY BREATH,"So I'm doing 16:4, but I'm *not* doing Keto. I eat pretty clean though, and don't consume added sugars or simple carbs etc. I'm 35lbs down and I've been seeing a doctor/registered dietician since New Years and it's really kept me on track. 

The other day I went to kiss my wife and she turns her head and says ""Okay, I don't know how else to say this, but your breath has been really bad for a while. I don't know what is going on, I love you, but please for the love of god your breath is terrible."" 

This took me aback, because I'd just brushed my teeth, and I floss regularly and use a waterpick. I'd heard about people on Keto/Atkins/Paleo having ""ketosis breath"" so I wondered if it was something like that, even though I'm eating carbs. 

Did some research, and it appears to me that you don't have to do a keto-style diet to actually have ketosis going on in your body. Any time you're in a calorie deficit and your body has to tap into fat reserves, this will bring on ketosis and cause your body to have to dispose of waste from burned fat. This is done in one of two ways: urine and your breath. 

It's why I still have a gross taste in my mouth even after flossing, waterpicking, and brushing. Apparently those things are only a temporary fix. The (best) solution is drinking more water, which will cause the waste to be expelled more through your urine. This makes sense, because I'm also guilty of not drinking as much water as I should be. 

Maybe I'm completely wrong, but there's a few sources out there that talk about this, and it does make sense. Keto diet probably takes this to the extreme, but any diet that brings on weight loss probably will have the added side effect of stinky breath.

If this happened 2 years ago, I'd be eating all my comfort foods (carbs and sugar) out of both stress and boredom. And to be fair, I have had some. But IF has changed my fundamental relationship with food. My food intake has dropped because...my activity level has dropped. I'm making sure I get enough to fuel the healing process, but I'm not doing hardly anything else, so I don't need big meals. I've been eating small meals of (mostly) healthy foods around medication times, and honestly feeling good about it. It's not that I'm resisting temptation, it's that what I actually want has largely changed.

It's a pretty amazing feeling. For so long I thought being healthy had to mean constantly fighting against the things I want, but it doesn't have to.  I've still got weight to lose to get healthier, but it actually feels possible, which it didn't for a long time.",intermittentfasting,1621038189

Rice, white bread, potatoes are completely out of my plan. I've read that it's better if you do not eat carbs at dinner, is that a fact?? 

I drink 3 L of water a day, plus sugar free green tea ( I have cut out sugar too) and my meals basically consist of milk, Greek yogurt, white goat cheese, cottage cheese, low calorie yellow cheese (10-14% fat), sliced turkey and ham, chicken, eggs (6 a week), tuna, sardines, salads, home cooked burger (veal, once a week), tenderloin (once a week), carbs I mentioned above, salads (mostly greens and Greek salad too), beans, peas, lentils, okra, fruit (apples, oranges, strawberries, cherries, peaches, orange juice), almonds, walnuts.

Other things I have with my food are linseed, mustard, low calorie mayo, olives and plenty of spices and olive oil ( 2 tablespoons every day). I'm thinking of trying peanut butter

I've been looking into IF and Water Fasting, even experimenting with the occasional few day fast, for about the past 2 years. Up until quite recently, I hadn't been able to muster the actual motivation and courage to begin my journey to claim my dream body and my happiness in it. 

I've always struggled with my weight, my whole entire life, and haven't ever fit the definitions of ""thin"", ""lean"", or ""fit."" I've never once in my life had a flat stomach and absence of love handles.  I'm 4 years on Female Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and it's just time to claim my true authentic self. I'm ready. 

I've been reading the sub for a little while and it really helped solidify my motivation. I had already began working out about a month ago and on at 5PM EST on 5/9/21 I began a 5 Day water fast to kick start my new weight loss, fitness and health journey. 

So, my 30 DAY WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY begins. From 5/9/2021 to 6/9/2021.
My goal/plan, moving forward from this very moment today, is: 

- daily 23:1 OMAD /Monday through Friday
- either 48hr or 72hr fasts ( water/plain black coffee) during weekends, so for example fasting from my last meal at 5PM Friday up to either 5PM Sunday or Monday
- at least 1hr of exercise/physical activity Monday through Thursday (typically this will be either jogging or walking stairs)
- when I do eat, during my OMAD, I will not be particularly limiting, although I will try to stay under 1500 calories. I intend to mostly eat things like fruits, veggies, fish, chicken, rice, and perhaps a diet coke, which I love. If I crave a junk food snack, I will allow myself to indulge, but only during my 1 hour eating window. 

On this Sunday, May 16th, 2021, I will post my first week's photo. Each following Sunday I will post an update picture and then the last day of my 30 day self challenge I will also post one. 

I'm doing this challenge to kick start a major period of transition and transformation, of growth and empowerment in my life. I'm trying to cultivate and establish a lifestyle, not a quick fix.

I have finally been able to stick to a good routine for the past 3+ weeks. One meal a day, targeting 1200-1500 calories. Low carb but not strict. No grains, root vegetables, or added sugars, but I will eat some fruit etc. Usually it's a huge salad with various greens, sweet peppers, cucumber, an avocado, a little cheese, a protein like a chicken breast or pork chop, some seeds or nuts, and plenty of oilbased dressing. I try to get enough variety to ensure a variety of vitamins etc. I also exercise 25-40 minutes a day on a rower, with 1 or 2 rest days per week.

So what happened.. Tuesday and Wednesday I had a hard time maintaining my usual pace on the rower. I managed to pick it up by the end Tuesday, but Wednesday I ended up cutting the session shorter than I had planned, I was just out of gas. Wednesday night/Thursday morning I had leg cramps during the night.

I figured electrolyte deficiency, so after I got up I mixed up a little K/Na/Mg solution and gulped it down, and started my coffee. When the coffee was ready and I stood up from the table to get it, I had a prolonged dizzy/faint spell, a good 10 seconds.

So I called a moratorium on the diet for the day, busted out a bowl of cereal and a handful of grapes, and basically spent the day eating like 'normal'. I probably ended up having 2200+ calories. I felt weak as a kitten at work during the course of the day. Not bad or ill, just like my muscles didn't have the ability to do what I asked of them.

Today I'm feeling much better. Maybe not 100%, but the scare seems to be over. Now I'm trying to assess what went wrong. Am I overdoing the diet? Is the calorie deficit too much and my metabolism is starting to punch back? Am I not going far enough with the ketogenic diet? Too much protein and carbs keeping me just out of the full fat-burning zone, so I'm operating in the worst of both worlds?

8937,This is actually working?!,"Started 18:6 on May 2. I [32F, 5'7""] have had a couple days since that I didn't hit my time goal but that's okay! On weekdays, I stay with my 18:6 and on weekends, I try for 16:8 at least. I really try hard not to stray from the times. Started my weight at about 227lbs and today, 225lbs even. Since May 11, I've been losing .4 per night. I'm finally seeing the trend go downwards. 

My heaviest was 235lbs and at that time I was paying ""coaches"" for diets and workouts and I only lost 2-3lbs and then it would come back. (I have spent a TON of money on people to help me and it's been a waste) So I've actually lost 10lbs since January, not the greatest timeline but it took time to find this, the simplest thing ever! 

My husband got The Obesity Code but neither of us picked it up to read and I started reading it a few nights ago. A lot made sense, although it can be a tricky read. Now that I'm seeing actual progress, I'm really starting to get it. I LOVE food but I am starting to like pushing through that last hour of hunger pangs to reward myself with my first meal and it tastes so good. I don't feel like I obsess the way I used to and I spend less time prepping and ZERO time measuring. That alone is a weight off my shoulders. 

My goal is to be under the 200's, in an ideal world 175 is my goal down the road. But we are thinking of having kids so if I can get under 200, I'll feel SO MUCH better about the possibility of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy. I basically REFUSE to get pregnant at the weight I am because diabetes runs in my family, my dad is pre-diabetic right now and trying to change that with food and his own fasting. 

I'm so happy and I hope I don't screw this up because man I want some tacos. But I'm thrilled that I'm seeing progress and that I CAN DO THIS!",intermittentfasting,1620996630
8939,Intermittent Fasting helped improve my dry eyes! I seriously can't believe it!,"I was born with eye problems where I was extremely sensitive to light and my eyes were chronically dry. The light sensitivity improved over the years, but was put on medication to help my eyes produce natural tears that were difficult to do so for many years. 

Furthermore, for as long as I can remember, I've had different doctors and nutrionists tell me my body was seriously dehydrated no matter how much water I drank. My body just had poor water retention. 

I hopped on the IF wagon in February of this year. I've managed to lose a small amount of pounds as I have been hopping back and forth, but have seriously devoted myself as of last month which I'm looking forward to the progress I'll make. 

Yesterday I went to my eye doctor for an eye exam. After the exam, he compared my condition to how it was when I previously went to see him. He was really surprised, and I was really surprised, to find my eye condition had slightly improved - that they weren't as dry as they usually are, and that my vision was slowly improving!

Holy shit guys! This is huge! I'm 31 and to hear that after all these years moved me. Intermittent fasting really helped with this, and I really wanted to share the news with you guys. Thanks for inspiring me to get on this train and push forward with it. :)",intermittentfasting,1620995317

So I started IF around March this year and I seemed to have quickly dropped 18 pounds pretty quickly which I gmfigured was mostly water weight. I had a couple questions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- Am I going at a good pace? It seems, once I dropped to 182Ibs, I stagnated. I noticed my velly got a little smaller but I still feel like it could use some work. I was wondering if this is normal or if I should work more on dropping the weight and if so, how?

- Is 165 -170 pounds a good weight to be at with my age and height? I kept seeing online that the ideal weight for me is roughly 140-160 but whenever I mention that to friends they say that is dangerously low. So I was wondering what everyone here thought.",intermittentfasting,1620972736

8984,Extended fast vs zero net calories,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve seen some people doing extended fasts in the shape of consuming 0 calories for, say, 10 days. I‚Äôve been wondering what would be the differences between doing that and doing 10 days of 0 net calories: for example, you eat 800 calories and you exercise 800 calories (with low intensity activity such as walking).
I know the second option *is not a fast*, and I know that means that you won‚Äôt get the long fasting benefits. I also know that you shouldn‚Äôt be eating 800 calories a day, but since we support extended 0 calorie intake, I can‚Äôt see how this would be any different. What I am asking is about other kind of differences, for example:

- weight loss and posterior maintenance
- health requirements
- side effects (headaches, harm to gut bacteria)
- others

I‚Äôm just curious about this as a theoretical question, but just for full disclosure I am sort of doing the 0 net calories thing to give me a little bump in weight loss before the summer (been for 3-4 days without realising and may continue for a week if I feel like it, I‚Äôm doing 18/6). 36F, 168cm, SW 88.6kg, CW 80kg.

8986,Hardly IF and it Still Helps...,"3 years ago I was doing strict keto plus IF. For almost a year.  And, it worked. Yes better than any other attempt ever had.  

BUT.  Then, Life occurred.  One serious-but-expected life events followed by a couple very un-expected.  I regained most of it back over that year.

Then. 2020 came. Being at home makes it Easier AND Harder.  On-again and off-again periods of LC-IF-exercise.  

2021 - started the year at little under 240 lbs.  Stuck to resolution about month-n-half and lost a little. THEN. JUMPED OFF THE WAGON with both feet.  I now have a cabinet of carb-heavy foods, deserts on hand, eating bread-type foods again, etc.  

I HAVE BEEN EATING AS IF my goal were to Gain WEIGHT!!

The ONLY thing I have been doing, Barely, is IF - LITE.  Trying -- most days, anyway -- to wait at least 12 hours from last meal one day, before considering eating again the next.  THAT''s IT.  Some days I manage to ""procrastinate"" myself into a shorter ""eating window.""  But - other days I actually really want some breakfast and I go ahead.  

SO pretty much the only rule I'm regularly following right now, is, Only eat breakfast if I Really Really Want it; and, otherwise, notice when I finished eating last night, and wait 12-hours plus as much longer as I can manage that day, before eating again. 

BEYOND that.  I'm eating Lots of Terrible-For-Me food.  Lots.  

I should've gained back so much weight by now.  

BUT I HAVEN'T.  NOT ANY.  I *still* weigh a little under 240 pounds.

SO.  This is not the actual goal of IF.  But on the other hand for me this is a huge Victory.  I have NOT gained any pounds since the beginning of the year.  DEspite months of junk and carbs, and serious over-eating which led to not-exercising.  

I am Not encouraging any of those behaviors. Obviously if I had been eating well, my body would be in far better shape right now.  I did not re-gain pounds but I did re-gain inches and lost some nice tone. These months were time wasted, as far as my health. 

BUT I am just amazed -- and also encouraged, and hope it encourages others.  Instead of being swept all the way back over the waterfall of weight-gain, I have instead treaded-water, stayed-in-place, avoided further re-gain, just by a very Minimal effort of time-limiting my eating.  

And for anyone who has read this far, if you're wondering - I am now fully vaccinated, so have re-joined gym.  I plan to return to my healthy low-carb food plan AND intend to work on strengthening my ""fasting muscle.""  The Scale tells me I have Not lost much ground, and this has encouraged me to Get With It, get moving and stop eating.

But today I went and read that study, and the Growth Hormone spikes were seen after multiple days of fasting. As far as I could tell from reading the abstract, the earliest time period where the spike was seen was at 40 hours of fasting, with rates being massive after several days of fasting.

But, unless I am very much mistaken, the vast majority of people who do intermittent fasting do OMAD or 16 and 8, some form of a less than one day fast, very few people do multiple day fasts.

So, unless there is some research out there I am missing, the frequent claim that 16/8 or OMAD increases growth hormone does not appear to be true and is based on reading the headline of a study claiming fasting increases IGH without reading the study and seeing it means multiple day fasts.

9030,PSA: Reevaluate your meals,"I am by no means an expert on nutrition, human physiology, or anything really. I have just noticed a bunch of posts from newcomers, where their plan for starting IF is to cut out a meal or two, and just eat their normal lunch and/or dinner. Doing this will often be enough to put you at a caloric deficit so you lose weight, but if you are not making up your necessary fat, protein and micronutrients you are going to feel like crap and potentially harm your health. It also puts you at risk of burning out or bingeing.  

Now, if your breakfast previously consisted solely of pancakes, syrup and juice, you are probably doing okay. If you are cutting out an overly-processed sausage, egg and cheese that's great - but if that was a main source of protein for your day, you will need to find a way to work that protein back in. 

I know calorie counting isn't for everyone, especially those who have struggled with disordered eating. However, apps where you enter in what you are eating at least give you a rough idea of your macro and micro nutrient consumption. Otherwise, it can be really hard to tell what you're getting, and what you need.",intermittentfasting,1612977318

The last few nights I have fallen off into 6 hour ranges and guess what ? I am HUNGRY &amp; miserable. And .. even when I stick to my calories ... my weight has started to bump UP!!

Is this cortisol? Is it true ? Could lack of sleep really cause us to hang onto fat?

9037,Today I drank black coffee,"For the last month or so I had been having coffee with monkfruit sweetener and a sploosh of vegan oat creamer. As you can probably imagine, this was breaking my fast early but I refused to admit it, haha.

SO today I worked up the courage, put the pod in, put in a dash of salt to offset that bitter bitter bean juice and took a sip. It was pretty terrible, hot garbage water terrible.

BUT, I let it cool down for a while and then was able to drink it over the period of about an hour while doing tasks around the house. I was able to advance to an 18 hour TRUE FAST instead of my 14-15hr one's that were broken by that sweet creamy coffee. In fact, I would usually get a bit light-headed and hangry after the coffee but today I felt clear headed and like I wanted to do a longer fast! I didn't want to mess up my eating window for tomorrow though so I broke it just after 18 hours.

So if you're like me and couldn't give up the sweetener/creamer but aren't getting the results you want I implore you to try the coffee black!",intermittentfasting,1612976478
9042,Eating smaller portions but more often,"Hi all, so i spoke to my mother actually today and we talked about IF 16:8 and she mentioned she has a colleague that eat less but more often to always keep the metabolism engine going.

My mother said her colleague is loosing weight so I cant dismiss that the eat less but more often (assuming you are in calorie deficit) does not work.

From my understanding, IF can/will help reach those fat cells and get to use fat as energy and also during fasting that IF helps getting your inners cleaned up a bit :) hit the reset button so to speak.

So how come does eating less but more often to keep metabolism going help loose weight? there would be a constant supply of glycose in the blood? plus your body never really get time to reset its digestion system if you eat all day.

9058,Why am I getting a neck lump sensation (acid reflux like) after long periods of fasting for a week?,"To be clear I have this sensation right now as I'm typing and it persists all day making it hard to focus on anything else.

I have been doing intermittent fasting and dirty/healthy keto for 2-3 years starting from 2017. In 2017 I was around 105kg (230lb) and I dropped to 75kg (165lb) by 2018. Last year (2020) I gained all the weight back while following a very unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, eating candy bars all day, etc.).

**Two weeks ago I started intermittent fasting and keto again, I was doing 24-27 hours fasting everyday and I felt great. Everyday I was eating at around 11PM (late at night) and I had a sensation of a lump in my neck a while after eating. I checked and I can't feel anything or see anything abnormal in my neck. Sometimes it gets better after eating but generally it gets worse. I have this feeling all day which made it impossible to stay on an empty stomach so I started eating minimal carbs in the morning and keto meals in the evening but the sensation won't go away. In the beginning it was like acid reflux, I was sleeping and waking up with my neck in pain but these days it also makes me feel lethargic and kind of hot like having a fever but that's not what you feel when you have a fever, you feel cold. I don't have the flu or any other symptoms.**

I have a bad habit. It takes me 3-4 hours to finish a cup of coffee (no milk) which I used to drink on an empty stomach while doing prolonged fasting. When I drink a cappuccino now it makes the lump sensation much more apparent and worse.

**I had this neck lump feeling a few years ago when I tried to do interment fasting for longer periods of time for the first time, I took apple cider vinegar which should increase the acid in my stomach and close the valve but it made things worse. I remember back then things were terrible, the pain was so much I couldn't sleep, it was really paralyzing and I had to stand all day, couldn't lay on the bed.**

Right now, I'm taking vitamin D, nutritional yeast, omega 3 (500EPA/250DHA) and I'm planning to buy vitamin K2, apple cider vinegar, zinc and vitamin A.

9080,Newbie Question Here,"Hi everyone, 

I just started IF about 3-4 weeks ago, I started with 12:12 and eliminating junk food from my life. I have slowly built up to 14-15 hour fasts. I have noticed that my appetite has taken a decrease and I only eat 2 big meals and maybe a small snack in my eating window. In all honesty, does that really make a difference (weight loss wise) from those people who are also doing 14-15 hour fasts? I'm utilizing the Zero app and of course doing all my necessary readings, I see that fat burning doesn't actually start until after 16 hours. I did my first 17 hour fast today and it was difficult, but I am not sure I can do those 20 hour fasts. I suffer from panic attacks and I have a very overactive awareness when it comes to my physiological state and anything that feels off sends me into a panic so I am not necessarily comfortable feeling ""off"" if that makes sense.

I was doing 16:8 with CICO and I lost 20+ lbs and gained some good muscle. At the time, my life was more active with working in a restaurant (easily 15k steps a shift) and college (walking around campus for classes). I was also training for a race back then (more emphasis on cardio). So staying in a calorie deficit was really easy.

Well between my last year of school and covid, I let maintaining slide and now I am trying to make up for it but I am not really seeing results. This time around I work in an office and sit on my ass all day but I do workout 5 days a week. I've been doing 16:8 but it usually goes to 18:6, with CICO but staying in a deficit is proving much harder with this new lifestyle.

My gym partner is trying to bulk so the workouts have been mostly lifting but I have been adding more cardio in the last 2 weeks and plan on doing more. I'll admit I need to be a little more strict with IF but I still expected to see more results than what I have.

I'm hoping it's just a matter of gaining muscle and losing weight at the same rate, but that's hard to determine. So if it's not, the only thing I can think of is that my calorie deficit isn't what I need it to be.

9124,IF and workouts,"Been doing IF 20:4 for about 3 weeks and I‚Äôm down 15lbs but the issue I‚Äôm running into is I feel I‚Äôm on a plateau already.. I stick to just water/black coffee and more healthy than unhealthy foods and I do strength/cardio for around 45-60 minutes first thing in the morning.  

I suppose there‚Äôs 2 questions involved.. Obviously obtaining muscle isn‚Äôt going to be as productive as it would‚Äôve been during a normal workout (outside of fasting) but is it counterproductive to do strength during a fast or does it help with calories in/out?  Also, what‚Äôs a good way to reset the body to get back into loosing weight during a plateau?  I did my first 50 hour fast the other day and felt great but I‚Äôve stayed the same ever since.

9125,Tips for how to transition from no real eating schedule to IF,"I had a pretty regular eating schedule growing up, but ever since moving out of my parents house 14 years ago it's been basically non-existent. Sometimes I eat snacks all day long, sometimes I have one huge meal, sometimes I have two or three meals, sometimes I barely manage to eat whatever junk food is easiest to consume, occasionally I forget to eat all together. The times of day I eat are all over the place, though I rarely eat right after waking up, pretty much anything from an hour after waking to right before bed is fair game, with no consistency at all. 

I think I sort of naturally seem to cycle between a week or two of feeling hungry all the time and wanting to eat non-stop, and then a week or so of basically being uninterested in food. I've also been a bartender and server my entire adult life and made a couple attempts at college as well so my work schedules, and sleep schedule, has been all over the place. Ignoring hunger is nothing new to me, often I'd have very limited windows of time available to eat just out of practicality.

I've certainly developed some pretty bad eating habits over the years. I basically eat whatever I want whenever I feel like it, but I also have days where even eating food let alone cooking seems like more work than it's worth. I've basically been doing the opposite of IF, eating food with no schedule whatsoever. 

I'm not at all looking to lose weight, despite my bad eating habits I've always been a healthy weight. I'm more interested in how IF can help me reset my circadian rhythm cuz that is all out of whack and has been for as long as I can remember. I also really struggle to develop and maintain any sort of routine, so I think IF could be useful in helping me get my whole life on more of a schedule.

What types of IF methods are best for non-weight loss goals? Any advice for how to transition into it as someone who struggles with sticking to schedules? How do you figure out what schedule works for you? I understand what works for each person will be different, but how did you figure it out? Just trial and error? Are there any tricks or tips to finding what works for you? I want to be healthier but I'm feeling very lost on how to start

9128,First time trying intermittent fasting for 24 hours (and possibly longer),"I'm 27, F, and trying to lose weight again. I have tried 20:4 before and it went fine. I am trying to fast with only water and coffee for 24 hours. I started at 5pm yesterday and now it's 2:30 pm. I'm 160cm and weigh 80kg, so I started with 16:8, then slowly transitioned to 20:4. I lost 10kg during the process and I stopped dieting completely, and gained around 4kg, so now I'm starting again. So far, this is what I experienced: 

Yesterday: 

\- 8pm: I got really hungry. I don't know if it was due to me watching how to make good food, or it's just because I'm aware of what I'm doing. 

\- 10:30pm : I drank water with vitamin-c. It doesn't have any calories so I think I'm fine. 

Today: 

8am: I started my day with a glass of water and a warm cup of black coffee without any creamer or sugar. I think coffee really helps with suppressing the appetite

10am: I did 10 pushups, 

12pm: still not hungry. My friend showed me a tiny video clip containing some delicious food and I didn't get hungry. 

1pm: I went for a 30 minute walk and I'm completely fine. I didn't feel fatigue. I don't know if it's because I have enough fat in my body to use as a fuel or something. 

Right now: I'm slightly sleepy, but I'm just bored and I don't have any music in the background. 

Overall, I think I'll manage until 5pm, possibly until tomorrow at 12pm too. Will I be fine? Should I stop fasting at 5pm or try to extend it and risk getting hungry at night? Thanks!",intermittentfasting,1612878036

I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, so there's a lot wrong with my system. I'm on thyroid medication but my levels really only start looking optimum when I follow the autoimmune protocol (AIP) combined with Intermittent Fasting.

I was doing 16:8 for a while and that was pretty good, but since I'd eat around 1:30pm that would mean I get tired in the afternoon. Since switching to 20:4, that means I don't eat until 4 or 4:30 and so I don't get tired until around 5pm, which is perfectly acceptable since the workday is over (or should be soon).

IF has helped me quickly lose the 20lbs I can easily gain in 4 months or so of overeating to get back to my ideal weight quickly, but basically I just like IF because without it I feel like lethargic shit about an hour after eating. It doesn't really matter what I eat, so it's not really an insulin resistance thing. If I'm just snacking a little, I won't get too tired, but if I eat a meal to really fill me up, it will make me sleepy even if it's just a can of tunafish and big bowl of greens with olive oil, neither of which is a carb or sugar.",intermittentfasting,1612815120
9178,What role does fasting play in your life? (x-post from r/fasting),"What role does fasting play in your life?

Fasting is powerful. When you really dig in, you discover it isn't just for weight loss. It's one of the most potent things we can do for our health, now and in the future. Our energy level, and focus.

Fasting is also hard. Fasting for 12 hours can be hard ‚Äî fasting for a day or a week, harder still.

That is where community comes in. If you're just starting out, having a big, loose community like this is nice. But if fasting has been a major part of your life for some time, perhaps you are looking for a smaller, tight-knit group of people who are committed to posting daily, whether or not we are on an extended fast.

We call ourselves The Fasting Gang, and we're very small (four-six people). We're entirely on Reddit (a closed, invite-only sub), and we post every day. Most of us practice intermittent fasting or ADF, and we also practice extended fasts. Every one of us has fasted for at least five days, and most of us do multiple five-day fasts a year, sometimes supporting each other as a group.

We have a couple of runners, a marathon swimmer, and people who use the power of fasting to manage various chronic conditions. We learn from each other all the time.

Right now is one of the rare times where we're looking for new members. We're only looking to add one or two people.

The two key rules of our community:

- We are in this for the long haul. Both fasting, and the community itself.
- Each of us comments or posts at least twice a week. No lurkers allowed (lurkers are removed).

If this sounds like it might be a good fit for you, please DM me with answers to the following questions:

1) What is the role of fasting in your life? Why do you fast?

2) What is the hardest thing about fasting?

3) What is the longest fast you've ever completed?

4) What wellness interests do you have, other than fasting?

5) Can you commit to commenting twice a week on a sustained basis?

Thanks, and good luck!",intermittentfasting,1612814568

From the Zero app to green tea and more water. Every post and comment I read convinced me that this was going to work for me. 

So I thought it time to stop lurking and give back to this community. 

So I thought I would share what a typical day looks like for me. A typical Monday on my journey. A kind of highlights show of my day.

So its up early at 06.15. Feed the cats and then its my morning HIIT workout on the 7 app. Yes I workout while fasted.

HIIT done its a pint of water before hitting the shower. 

Then its the morning walk. 2.7km regular lap and takes me about 30 mins. Again while fasted

When sat at my desk (working from home) its the first of many green teas and flasks of water.  Much green tea. Much water.

Normally there would be another walk. While fasted. Another 2.7km. But snow. So staying in the warm. 

Lunch. Or breakfast if you prefer, was at 1.30pm . Cheese and ham toastie. Maybe not the typical lunch usually consists of cereal. 

So that's my fast broken after 19.5 hours. Nice job. I remember when it was hard work getting to 16 hours. Now 18 is comfortable.

Onwards to dinner. I aim to be done before 7pm. And today I was. Happy days. So the clock starts ticking down from 18 hours and then anytime after 12.15 tomorrow I can break my fast once again.

Aim to be in bed by 10pm. Sleep is very important. 

So there you have it. Some of my typical day. 

The journey has had many variances. I built up to where I am today with experiments and trial and error. 

I am more than happy to answer questions.

Other than that I wish you all the very best on your journeys and may your chosen plans bring you the results you seek. Good luck.",intermittentfasting,1612813242

9191,Why I Love IF!,"I did IF the second half of last year but I ""quit"" this past January because I was doing a workout program that involved over 40 minutes of HIIT every day for 3 weeks and IF was not sustainable for me. I quit that program, too. But due to multiple factors, my cravings and appetite were out of control even when I switched to more steady cardio/strength training activities. It's only Day 1 of returning to IF and I remember why I did it: 

&amp;#x200B;

* I drink more water. 
* It curbs my hunger and I managed my cravings better. 
* My stomach doesn't feel so *full* or bloated. 
* Less meal planning. 
* My muscles POP out more.   


I'm only doing 15:9 or 14:10 fasts instead of 16:8 because I read multiple sources that said long-term fasting can effect female hormones. I do not feel that it is necessary that I fast for the standard window. Not to mention, if I accidentally eat an hour late (around 1pm) , I get anxiety, I'm shakey, and my blood sugar feels low, and I don't feel great.

I'm posting this to see if you guys can help me out. I've been trying the IF method for almost a year - then kinda relapsed during lockdown but picked it up again. I've been IF'ing for about 2 - 3 months now but haven't been able to shake any weight at all. 

My first round of IF last year made me lose about 3 - 4kg, which I've all regained unfortunately. I've been fasting for about 16 to 18 hours a day; I usually eat between 2pm and 8pm.

\- about 1m75  
\- SW: 93kg

\- GW: 70kg  


Some info;  
I don't smoke, I don't drink coffee. No tea. Haven't really had alcohol since last year - at most 1 glass of ww every 2 weeks. I drink about 2-3 liters of water a day, and have cut any type of soft drinks for about a month. I've picked up core exercises again which I do about 4 times a week for 10 - 15 minutes (I use the Home Workout App). Pr√© lockdown I played rugby 2-3 times a week, this has completely fallen away because of the covid regulations in my country. My meals are balanced; and only occasionally do I eat a cookie or something outside of fasting.

Results:

I‚Äôm down to about 11 stone 12 pounds, which I‚Äôm very happy about.. but.. I‚Äôm amazed I haven‚Äôt lost more. I‚Äôve really really restricted my eating, I essentially only drink a green smoothie I make from scratch for lunch, and a handful of almonds, and then I try to eat dinner by 6/7 to then eat again at about 11am the next day. 

My question, would I see much better results if I carried on my fast through the weekends? The only thing that alters my routine at the weekends (fri and sat) is that drinking alcohol then becomes the thing that breaks my fast. I enjoy drinking a lot and don‚Äôt intend to change that on the weekends. I also have a ‚Äúcheat/fun‚Äù meal once on the weekends, usually Saturday night. 

So, to conclude, I absolutely have enjoyed and seen so many benefits from IF. I appreciate food more, I actually enjoy being hungry sometimes which is new to me and I don‚Äôt intend to stop. But I will admit, others on here seem to lose weight SO much quicker from me, and I guess I want to discuss if anyone else enjoys a drink at the weekends and sees better results? Where might I be going wrong, or is everyone just different I guess, and I should carry on another 6 months and be more patient?

Thanks so much!

9206,Week 1 of IF check in,"So 1 week has gone by while I(22F) try to practice healthier habits. I‚Äôm posting here for accountability for my first 8 weeks as well as to share my experience for others to reference. 

My current goals are :

1. Exercise on a consistent schedule
2. Practice mindful eating (not snack too late and eat more balanced meals)

This week I wanted to do 4 days of 16/8 and exercise for 30 minutes for 4 days. I did my goal of IF for 4 days, almost 5 days but I broke it this morning 2 hours early in order to get some food as I was going to go on a long bike ride and knew it would not be good news for me to accidentally fast too long twice in a row(My 3rd fast I accidentally did 18 hours because I went on a hike but was definitely feeling hangry at the end of it). It was definitely a challenge and often during the first hours of the fast I wanted to eat something even though I was full.  Something I want to take away from that experience is to try to stay hydrated and curb eating something just out of habit. Overall starting a goal of 4 days IF a week, I think will work for now as it‚Äôs not too much that I just feel like giving up.

My other goal was to exercise for 30 minutes for 4 days and this is where I fell short. I did yoga for 2 days for 30 minutes and went on a 17 mile bike ride today but it wasn‚Äôt consistent which is what I‚Äôm aiming for. For this next week I am scheduling my workouts on specific days instead of basing it on my pure will because otherwise I‚Äôll just push it off for the next day and that's a habit I want to break. Overall it was a bit difficult this week but I‚Äôm not going to let that stop me. For this next week I will continue with my goal of 4 days doing IF but changing my exercise goal to 30 minutes running for 4 days as I want to train for a 10k but also doing yoga 30 minutes a day so that I work on both and hope that by doing so I won‚Äôt short myself of the needed cardio

Yesterday I went back to 16:8 for the day and had a light breakfast, went wine tasting with my husband (our first date since we had our twins in September), and ate cheese, olives, and nuts, then came home and ate chicken, salad AND a cupcake, and woke up this AM to 198lbs on the scale after weeks of 199.

9245,Beat inflammation with fasting,"One of the greatest health risks of all time is inflammation üî•

The root of the word in Latin means ‚Äòset fire‚Äô and that‚Äôs exactly what chronic inflammation does:

It can ‚Äòburn up‚Äô your tissues and organs leaving them failing in their ability to do their job, which of course, has tremendous and negative consequences on your health.¬†

Fortunately, there‚Äôs a way to ease inflammation and allow your body to use it to its advantage, and that‚Äôs through intermittent fasting:

**Beat inflammation with(out) food**

A significant amount of research shows that periods of fasting from food may improve body mass, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. Now, why would that be?

Throughout early history our routines were largely dictated by a day night cycle. Without a constant supply of electricity, our ancestors were forced to be active during daylight hours, but rest at night. Food intake was also dictated by its availability. 

Most people would eat during restricted feeding windows, and only what was available to them, allowing their bodies to fast naturally.¬†

Today, that‚Äôs not the case. Not only do we tend to graze all day, but when we burn the candle at both ends, staying awake far longer than we should, oftentimes we use that time to consume more food. We have to ask the questions then: if we hardly ever take a break from eating and we don‚Äôt rest when we‚Äôre supposed to, our bodies don‚Äôt have time to perform those critical duties that only happen during times of fasting.

The effects? Lower defense mechanisms with increased susceptibility to infections, heightened metabolic stress with insulin resistance and high blood sugar, and an increased number of damaged cells and reduced tissue repair, which are hallmarks of the signs of ageing and disease. 

In other words, *not* fasting means lots of redness, pain and swelling in the body‚Äôs tissues and organs; inflammation that leads to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia and cancer.¬†

9266,The difference between 72 hours prolonged fasting and my plan.,"Hi everyone,

I have a question regarding the effect of a 72 hours water fast in comparison to the effect of 96 hours while having one small meal (20% of my daily intake) a day with 2 exercise session at the beggining of the fast.

I am a young man living with my parents, thus to avoid a crazy reaction from them I am thinking about transitioning from my initial plan of a 72 hours fast to what I have explained previously. I am doing IF for 2 and half years already (I am young but past puberty and growing stages) and it is going great. Been doing warrior diet from Sunday-Thursday, then 24 hours (with workout at the middle) to Friday and one meal on Saturdays.

My longest fast was like 36 hours. Wasn't challenging at all. 

My goal is to reach the late stages of autophagy of a 72 hours fast. This goal includes rejuvenation of the immune system, healing of internal body parts, and increase in stem cells.

As of now I am at a 22 hours fast with one workout, and I am very energetic so I can easily add another one soon. Before the 22 hours fast I ate a 20% meal, therefore if I choose to do the 96 hours meal plan I am 36 hours in since I started.

Unfortunately variate is surgery isn‚Äôt available through public health unless you‚Äôre a type 2 diabetic on 2 different diabetic meds. My endo doesn‚Äôt understand this as she says my weight alone should be enough to get me the help I need. So now she‚Äôs doing what she can to help me. 

I eat maybe a cup of food twice a day and have been trying to practice the 16:8 schedule. Usually I am not hungry in the morning but will have a cup of tea (small milk 1 sugar). I eat a small lunch and a small dinner. I think that eating so little is not so good? But it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have plenty of fat to go around. I wonder if my body thinks it‚Äôs starving or something and secretly storing fat??? 10kg seems a bit excessive? I‚Äôd say some would have been fluid retention also because my feet are back to my normal feet before I got pregnant. I always had swelling around my ankles and the top of my feet which have been gone since I started medication. 

Is there anything I can be doing to keep me going or should I just not do IF because of my medication schedule? Regardless of if I‚Äôm IF or not I‚Äôm still only eating once or twice a day. Drink plenty of water, no soft drink, a lot of my meals are still pasta and rice based because my children only eat pasta or rice based meals so I‚Äôm pretty happy that I can only eat a small amount. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how to slowly remove carbs not only for me but for my sons as well... they‚Äôre only 4 and pretty anti vegetable.. they will eat vegetables mashed in potato.. or sweet potato but won‚Äôt touch a veggie out in the open.

9285,"Food for thought? Correct me if I'm wrong, but....","My understanding of fasting is that at some point, the body starts using body fat for energy. Every time we eat, it interrupts that process. Ingested food becomes our fuel until it runs out.

If that's the general idea, is there any reason to make a special effort to get 'enough' calories? A lot of people fear lowering metabolism when eating too few calories, but if my understanding is accurate, that doesn't make sense. If the body is burning it's fat stores, metabolism should be unaffected by too few ingested calories (assuming there's plenty of stored fat). If anything, more ingested fuel would only delay the next fat-burning cycle. Am I wrong?

Yes, I know studies have shown metabolism speeds up when a person fasts over time, but I'm more specifically interested in the effect food intake has with regard to 'starvation mode' and IF.",intermittentfasting,1616977659

9302,A look back at one month of intermittent fasting,"For personal purposes, just wanted to write down my reflections of doing this for a month.

**Background**

The pandemic really took a dent in my eating habits. Being so close to food all the time, allowed me to snack inadvertently throughout the day. On top of that the ease of getting food via UberEats and DoorDash allowed me to easily eat out a lot more as well as more importantly, eat a lot more sugar. It hit a peak around September of last year when I tried making a positive change in what I eat (less fast fast food, more cooked meals) and the frequency (less snacking, more structured meals).

From September till March, I followed a pretty good regiment but I kept going back to eating a lot of sugar. Everything from cookies to cakes to ice cream. Around end of February is when I found intermittent fasting and wanted to try it out to see if I could further any positive habits

**Weight &amp; Fitness**

In addition to creating positive habits another outcome I was hoping to see was shedding a few pounds back to a reasonable weight.

My weight fluctuates A LOT from year to year based on what I'm training for etc. February of 2020 I was at 140. The previous year I had been training for a full marathon and was really disciplined about my eating habits. At the lowest point I was around 133.

Due to the pandemic and WFH, I let my weight go and in Aug 2020 I was at a peak of 171. I had already been working out a lot at that point but my weight was still going up due to lack of proper food. And that's when I tried making the positive change in September.

The peloton bike has been my only form of fitness for the last year, with a more structured plan from September onwards.

I usually do 4 hours of HIIT per week on the Peloton shedding around 4000 calories with an average heart rate of 180.

**Goal (in that order)**

* Get more disciplined
* Reset my gut
* Lose weight

**The Numbers**

* **Start Date:** February 26th
* **Start Weight:** 161lbs
* **Total Fasts:** 30
* **Longest Streak:** 30
* **7-Fast Avg:** 19.1h
* **Longest Fast:** 22.1h
* **Total Hours Fasted:** 555.6h
* **Current Weight:** 155lbs

**Learnings**

* I realized that my day was dictated by meals and that's how I split my day up. I looked forward to meals because of that break in the day. Instead now, after a month intermittent fasting, I replaced food as that breakpoint with other activities. Food is not the main part of the day
* A lot of times I wasn't hungry, I was just thirsty. I started drinking 2L of water that helped.
* Black plain coffee is a good hunger suppressant
* It gets easier. I remember how I prepared to ""embark"" on my 20h fast the first time I did it. But now a 22hr fast seems easy peasy.

**Open Questions**

* I'm really not sure how I can continue to incorporate this into my lifestyle. Right now I use Zero and it's almost like a game for me. Not sure how I jump from game to habit.
* I still eat a good amount of sugar when I eat. I have such a big sweet tooth. I need to cut that out.
* The 22hr to 36hr jump seems so big, if I want to do more . Not sure how I can do it.

Except, of course, I'm not starving. I've been fasting since some time actually and have lost weight too(which they've noticed). 
I have tried explaining what it is, why it works for me, the benefits I've personally seen other than weight loss(like better skin, again- which they have noticed) but despite this they refuse to accept that this is a long term strategy and instead believe that this is ultimately detrimental for me. 

During my fasting period they force me to eat food, constantly nag me to eat something, they think this is an ED(I used to have one, but not anymore). This just makes it SO MUCH MORE difficult to go through with the fast. Even if I'm genuinely just not hungry, not even avoiding food due to the fast, I feel this pressure to be eating food.

9319,Intermittent Fasting @ 20/4. Between 500-1000 calories a day. Slower than expected results.,"So about 6 weeks ago, with the help of my amazing wife, I started a VERY aggressive diet. For the record, I am morbidly obese. I'm 5'10'' and, at my worst, I was 340 pounds.  


I initially started an easy 20/8 diet in which I generally just skipped breakfast and then had lunch at 11, dinner at 5 or 6, and stopped eating by 7. Using this method, with little to no calorie counting I dropped down to 314. I also quit drinking literally ANYTHING during this period except water.  


Maybe 6 months went by and I wasn't happy with how fast the weight was dropping, so I turned up the gas. In mid February I went to 20/4, eating usually a single meal and NEVER eating before 4 or after 8. Moreover, I began METICULOUSLY counting calories with an app. To my surprise I was able to maintain a 1500-1900 calorie deficit every day (except Saturday's which I set aside as my cheat day).

In those 5-6 weeks I've dropped down to 299 (yay back in the 200 club!). As awesome as that is, I was kind of expecting to lose weight faster? 14 pounds in \~5-6 weeks? Each of those weeks, including cheat days, would see me at at an 8k-10k deficit overall. I thought 3500 calories = 1LB?

I have been wondering about the results you get from stopping IF and if anyone took a break from it and got back to it, what happened in that ""off"" period? what did you notice? 

I'm a 20 years female (5'7) that had done IF for almost a year in 2018 and stopped. However, I haven't kept track of my weight on it so I don't have any weight differences except one where I remember weighing 57 kg (125lbs) (consuming round 1000-1200kcal) in December 2018 and later after stopping IF and getting to normal eating windows (now) I weigh 61 kg, around 134 lbs. I want to know if this is a normal effect of going off IF (keep in mind i kept around the same amount and quality of food (consume aorund 1500kcal+ i walk more) or because I increased my food intake; which in my opinion would be bit extreme since it was a slight change that ended up in me gaining extra 10lbs throughout the years :( and I feel that all the ""fat"" I lost on IF, I just regained.

My concern is that I am getting very watery diarrhea within a couple hours of that first meal.

My meals are also healthier than before - primarily grilled chicken or steak with veggies and maybe a little rice or potatoes.

I am guessing this is simply an adjustment process but I am also curious as to other user's experiences with IF and diarrhea...

9345,Why Fasting is the Best Way to Lose Weight,"Recently I wrote an article that explores why fasting is a better way to reduce body fat than just counting calories.

Here are some key takeaways:

--Nowadays people are eat 5 or 6 times a day, rather than just 3

--Eating all day long keeps your insulin high, which promotes fat storage. You literally can't burn body fat when your insulin is high

--Intermittent fasting (a.k.a. Time-restricted eating) gives a little more time each day for your insulin to come down, which lets you access your body fat for energy more easily

--A ketogenic diet keeps your insulin even lower, so it's easier to burn body fat

--Ketones also boost your metabolic rate, stimulate ""brown fat"", and literally carry energy/calories out of your body (through your breath and urine)

--Prolonged fasting gets insulin even lower, and maximizes fat burning for a longer duration

--Multi-day fasting can also reduce insulin resistance by clearing out fatty deposits in your liver and pancreas

--Daily calorie restriction slows down your metabolism because your body will adapt after a while

--Calorie restriction also leads to more loss of lean body mass

--fasting doesn't slow down your metabolism in the long run, since you don't do it the same way all the time

--Fasting also preserves muscle mass through a few different mechanisms

This was definitely an interesting topic to explore!

9407,Need to get back on trap asap!! Accountability post/accountability buddy would be nice too. Advice to stop making excuses for myself ?,"I've been not fasting these past few days and just been screwing up A LOT recently not being strict with myself. I keep fucking making excuses for myself to break my fasts like ""oh I've already lost weight, I'm just trying to maintain now so it's ok."" But it's not ugh!! I don't wanna maintain I'm still overweight!! Or things like ""you're going through a stressful time  it's ok you'll get back on track tomorrow."" And normally I'd agree breaking a fast every once in a while is okay. But I don't think I'm one of those ppl that can have a cheat day. Turns into a cheat week/weeks üôÑüôÑüôÑ And like I genuinely feel like shit when I don't fast anymore. My gastrointestinal issues are back (not as bad but still). Anyways end of rant. If anyone has been having trouble with discipline hmu we can help each other ? I used to be so motivated, watching IF YouTube vids/coming to this subreddit and I guess I never realized how much it helped me  ""stay strong"" so yeah deff gonna lurk here more now again. This subreddit is great :))",intermittentfasting,1615951267
9408,Is it bad to increase fasting time,Hello I‚Äôm a 23m 6ft in college currently 170lb but trying to get to 160 and I‚Äôve been looking into intermittent fasting as a way to really reach my bodies full potential. So I was thinking of just doing a normal 8 hours on 16 hours off routine but I drink late into the night on most Fridays and Saturdays. So would it be bad if increased my fasting time just on those days to get the alcohol into my eating period or does anyone have a better idea?,intermittentfasting,1615950226
9409,What is the best source of Electrolytes during a fast,"I've been trying to do IF on and off for a few years,  giving it a serious crack this time,  aiming for 20:4 as I have never had an issue not eating (not in an unhealthy way,  I'm obese) However i have historically struggled to get the electrolytes i need during the fast period and as a result suffered from cramps and other muscle issues as a result.  What can i do to get Magnesium, Potassium,  and other electrolytes to support my body functions during a fasting period?",intermittentfasting,1615949980

9416,Blood Pressure Increase on Long Fasts?,"I've been experimenting with longer fasts the past two weeks, a couple of 48 hour fasts and a 36 hour fast.  Normally i do 20:4 during the week, do cardio workout fasted, and usually do whatever on the weekends.  My blood pressure is pretty good, one day last week it was 115/74.  But i noticed during any extended fast my blood pressure was way up, just now (hour 44 of fasting) it was 144/80.  My understanding is fasting should cause my BP to go down?  My resting heart rate was 50 just now, so it's all a bit of a mystery....anyone know why my BP would go up?",intermittentfasting,1615939984
9418,Thyroid test and fasting?,"Just had bloodwork done and my TSH is off indicating hypothyroidism. My Dr wants to re test in 6 weeks. I was fasting when I gave blood wondering I that could make a difference.

9425,This is dumb I know but I'm pretty underweight and every time I see the phrase face gains I think you're talking about a face getting bigger..,"I try so hard to be a healthy weight but my health gets in the way so hard and there's no great support for gaining weight. At least none that I've found. 

I'm currently on a no dairy gluten nightstade diet and I think it's helping but I feel like there is so little I can eat and everything I loved growing up has those things.

I want face gains so my face looks full and healthy. 

I know this is the wrong sub I'm sorry",intermittentfasting,1615929841
9426,Any tips for not eating too much junk while in the eating period?,"So I can fast well, but what gets me down from achieving my health goals is the snacking on unhealthy things while I‚Äôm in my eating period. Like I‚Äôd go to the kitchen and have some random candy/chocolate/snack (I don‚Äôt live alone so I can‚Äôt really control the presence of snacks in the house) and tell myself ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt eat, so you can have this‚Äù but I end up messing up my fitness goals but doing so. I have tried heathy snacks in the past but I ended up eating too much or having junk after (because I craved the taste). I have successfully participated in intermittent fasting years ago, but it was a different stage of my life and was way easier to do so back then. I just didn‚Äôt have the cravings and I don‚Äôt know how. I would appreciate the advice please.",intermittentfasting,1615927783

I was wondering if it's worth it to switch my IF every other day to fit my hectic schedule or if I should stick to a less severe (but doable every day) schedule. I want to loose weight and get back in shape, I don't really have a goal in mind, I just want my body to ""feel"" healthy again (it doesn't right now) and fit in a nice jumpsuit I have that is a bit too tight...",intermittentfasting,1615927748
9429,Currently in a 2 month plateau - Help!,"Hey y'all,

I have been doing IF 6:18 since November and I lost 5 kgs, which I am super happy with. However, I am still overweight and have about 15 kg to lose, still.

I have hit a plateau 2 months ago, and my weight is not moving.

I try to create a 500 cal deficit every day, and exercise regularly (either walking 7 km or 1 hr bike ride about 5 times a week).

I work a lot, about 60 hrs a week right now. I feel like I can't cut down on my caloric intake anymore (about 1500 cal per day).

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks in advance!!",intermittentfasting,1615925832
9432,Flat muscles.,"First off. I have done IF in the past, had 8 pack, absolutely ripped due to training 5 days a week/skipping etc along with macro tracking. 

Fast forward a few years, I'm doing it again. Still training 4 to 5 times a week. Now, my question is.. I've noticed my muscles (biceps) getting flat. Is this due to IF, lack of carbs possibly and less protein?

I'm around 14% body fat so not overweight or anything just trialing IF due to tightening up love handles etc.

So the people advise me whether or not this is due to IF.. My rep range currently 8 to 10 reps fairly light compared to what id usually do.",intermittentfasting,1615923792

I have been trying to stay in a caloric deficit but find it hard because whenever I eat, it basically makes me hungrier. I like to eat until I'm full and unfortunately that doesn't work with caloric deficits. Lol Im not sure if OMAD would be a good way to go here as I've read it works well for maintenance. Any suggestions? I tend to do strength training 4-5 days each week and every day I go for about 2-3 mile walk depending on how I feel. I run 2 miles 3 times per week.

I‚Äôm loving the journey and seeing the scales drop every couple of days but I‚Äôm starting to worry I‚Äôm not ‚Äòseeing‚Äô any difference.

Anybody have a similar experience?",intermittentfasting,1615922050
9435,"Not even a month in, and what IF has given me so far","This is long and rambling. TLDR: Yay!

So I started IF on 26 January, after going onto blood pressure pills and booking in for a blood test to check my blood sugars (that's happening next month). I was 108 kgs (238 lbs) and diabetes runs in the family so I'm working on the assumption that I've got bad news coming up. 

Since then, I've been doing at least 16:8, sometimes more. Sometimes at work I don't get time for lunch at 12, so it'll be a longer fasting period, or accidental OMAD.

I aim to get about 1200 calories a day but if I'm honest it's hard to get there some days! We've gone pretty much keto just because we've decided to ditch potatoes, pasta, rice and bread, and it turns out that's where a bunch of our calories came from before. We've replaced them with even more veges - we already ate a lot of veges so it ends up being a great big pile of food.

It's been going weirdly easily. I've lost 5 kgs (11ish lbs) and haven't been tempted to cheat. I've cut down my alcohol consumption *dramatically* - I used to drink too much every evening, I'm embarrassed to admit, now I drink in moderation on Friday and Saturday nights. 

It all came to a head yesterday. Not long after I got to work (it's a fairly stressful office job) there was a pretty bad development which will add substantially to my already unreasonable workload for the next five or six months. And five minutes later I got a message from my sister to let me know my Mum (who is one of the best people in the world) was in hospital with confusion and memory loss. They thought she may have had a stroke.

I had every excuse to binge eat, and binge drink in the evening. *But I didn't.* I ate the healthy serving of homemade chicken and vege curry (no rice) that I had taken for lunch. I would have snacked on the apple I had in the fridge, had someone in the office not eaten it for me. (Ngggg.) And then I walked home, ate a beautiful homemade peanut stew and roasted broccoli, and had a long, reassuring online chat to my family. (Mum's fine - scans came back clear and she's on antibiotics for an infection.)

IF has evened my moods, given me back control, and is giving back my health. I feel quite evangelical about it at the moment - this is the tool that I needed. And it's a fantastically supportive community!",intermittentfasting,1615921917
9436,Massive gym goer. When is best time to fast,"So o have been going to the gym for about 1 year and o can say I am addicted. I‚Äôve lost some weight but the highest change is on my body shape. I lift weights 6 days a week and I do HiiT 3 times a week. I also walk and run a lot. My diet is currently using macros but I am not losing enough on this, I feel like I need to eat more than what my TDEE says and then inevitably overeat in my evening meal. I am considering trying IF and skipping breakfast and then eating my macroed meals for lunch and dinner. This would in theory mean I can eat lever meals to fuel my workouts. Anyone else gym and IF?

9443,Anyone using daylight savings to your advantage?,I usually break my fast at 11am even though I‚Äôve been wanting to go until noon.  Yesterday I was surprised how non hungry I got at 11am and thought it was because all weekend I went until 2-3pm to eat (slept In late) so I thought I was making progress.

Longer version: I prefer to eat breakfast around 3 hours after I wake up. Now I have the choice to eat 1/2 hour or 6 hours after I wake up. I can't eat outside my lunch break (6 hours after I wake up) and I have to bike 30 minutes (moderate to high intensity) to get to work. I feel weak while biking if I haven't eaten, and I'm not as focused as I could be while working when I'm fasting and have biked. I'm F27 with a normal BMI. I REALLY hate eating early. Im not hungry and then get hungry after 1,5 hours. I end up eating a whole meal more than I normally would, therefore I would gain weight in the long run and I've lost 12 kgs with CICO that I want to keep off.

9473,"Creatine, weight training and weight gain","Hey everyone. I've been doing IF since October kinda on and off, since Jan I've been pretty consistent (18:6) and lost a good chunk of weight. Oct 200lbs, Jan 182lbs. (30M, 6'1"")

Around a month ago, I started weight training again (double vaxxed). And about 2 weeks ago I started taking creatine. My weight has gone from \~182lbs to 192lbs in that time. I try to use the 3-site caliper method for BF calcs but haven't really seen any changes, kinda fluctuates between 23% and 19%.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm assuming most of the weight I lost and have since gained is water weight...

Like days when I‚Äôm doing OMAD it will go down around 178 but then as soon as I eat will go back up to 182 - 183. I‚Äôm getting about 1200 - 1300 calories a day, and trying to eat healthier proteins along with mostly fruits and vegetables! But it doesn‚Äôt matter if I do OMAD or 16:8 2 meals. I just keep lingering between 179 - 183. So tl;dr I‚Äôm not seeing any improvements really and was curious if this was normal at the beginning or possibly the amount of calories I‚Äôm getting is halting progression? Or something a bit more scientific that I don‚Äôt fully understand yet? Lol! Also at the moment I haven‚Äôt been exercising at all yet because I‚Äôve been waiting to get my second Covid shot tomorrow before I started going to the gym again, so that may also be a factor.

9491,What's your favorite benefit of fasting outside of weight loss?,"I started fasting about 6 weeks ago (anywhere from 16:8 to 19:5) and I've been surprised at how good I've felt since starting. I've been sleeping better, feel more clear headed, and just in general physically feel good. 

I also think fasting has helped my relationship with food. About 5 years ago I lost 85lbs with CICO. And while it helped me get the weight off, I think the process warped my view of food and calories. Fasting has simplified things - I eat when I eat and I don't when I don't. This aspect is my favorite benefit so far.

This means that beer is ALL AROUND ME and pretty much free for the taking.

Now I‚Äôm not a heavy drinker by any stretch, but I have begun drinking more since starting this job - mainly to get used to the (extensive) beer selection.

It's been 2 years since I have started to eat only in the window of 2PM up to 8 PM.  80% of the time.

It's been quite some time and today I woke up and ate at 9 PM. It felt a bid odd but I do feel good. I wonder if this will help me fall asleep earlier tonight for some reason. Can I eat breakfast for a week or two? When will I resume IF, will I feel big hunger in the mornings?

9505,24 hour Ramadan fasting I'm really struggling,"I'm in the UK and this year I'm really struggling. 
It should be easy given the month and weather but it's not. 

Technically We fast from about 4am something to 8pm something. About 16 hours. No food or drink

However. I don't wake up 3am to have my morning meal before fasting the whole day. 

So essentially I come from work, wait till 8 something pm, eat them sleep.

9511,How big of an issue is regularly breaking fast?,"Hi, I'm new to IF. Been doing 18:6 (noon-6pm) for the past 10 days with no issues and have seen a weight loss of around 5 lbs. 

Keeping a *mostly* consistent 18:6 schedule shouldn't be too much of an issue for me. My family eats meals on a clockwork schedule everyday: 7:30am breakfast, noon lunch, and 5:30pm dinner. I have a cup of black coffee for breakfast and then can eat a normal lunch and dinner with my kids and wife. 

But on Sundays, my family likes to get bagels for breakfast and I'd like to join them without giving up the 5:30pm Sunday dinner. I'd still maintain a calorie deficit for the day. 

Being new to IF, I'm at a bit of a loss on the mechanics. How much of a negative impact does breaking fast one day a week cause? Would adding in a 24-ish hour fast beforehand (6pm on Friday-5:30pm on Saturday) help mitigate this break in fast on Sunday?

On that note, I would love to read more in depth than the current wiki or FAQ on the mechanics of IF and especially on the importance of consistency. Does anyone have any links to a few good posts on the subjects?

9528,Trying IF as someone with extreme obesity,"Hey everyone!

## Disclaimer

This post will be long, sorry for that and please bear with me.

I am new to reddit and new to IF, I just created this account to be able to part of this community. I have read the FAQ, watched a numbers of videos about fasting and IF in general in the past 4-5 days. But I will have a lot probably really dumb questions and I hope you guys can help me.

## About me

Sorry, I am not mentally ready and I don't know if I ever will be to upload a picture of myself, so believe me. So in bullet points:

* Male
* Doing sedentary job (sitting behind a desk in 8 hours/day)
* 30 (almost 31) years old
* Hight: 176 cm (5'8"")
* Start (current) weight: 164 kg (362 lbs)
* I don't really have any health issues, nor pains (beside high blood pressure, which I take medications. It is most probably because of my weight).

## My goal

I have been overweight in my whole life, and now I finally have the courage and the willpower to change that. At least I really hope that.

* I want to loose weight, be fit, feel happy when I look into the mirror. I THINK my goal weight would be around 90 kg (198 lbs). But honestly I never thought about that, just ""much less then now""
* If I am not too arrogant / cocky, I would love to have / gain some muscles as well - again for the fit and happy with the mirror reasons.

## My plan

I think I get the methodology behind fasting and IF. I think I will start with 16:8 and maybe in a month or so if I am used to it, I can include some OMAD or something. I can hardly believe I can do multiple days of fasting and I don't want to ""overdo"" it, just create a healthy plan which I can get used to and keep doing it like ... forever?

## Questions

1. Calorie, vitamins and micro/macro stuff counting: How the \*\*\*\* could I able to do that? It really sounds easy: ""just add up what I eat"", but in practice: If I order food online (which I do most of the times) and it does not lists properly the raw materials and the portions (which it does not), how can I know what these values are to be able to track them?!
2. Maybe this is the same as the first question but: How should I know if I need extra ""something""? Like vitamins, electrolyte, or just the basic protein/fat/carb, or ... anything?
3. In typical 16:8 fasting day:
   1. how should I portion my food (calorie) intakes? With 2 bigger meal?
   2. when should I do some workout? Do you recommend workout at all? If so, when to take protein shake with that?
4. Any other tips? :)
5. Could you recommend any videos / podcasts, info? I know it is frowned upon but I don't like to read books, so any audiobook, video source would be much more better, which I can listen to during travel and walks.
6. I know I have a thousand more questions, but I can not form any of that into a real sentence now, so ANY type of help is REALLY appreciated. I think It would be nice to be able to talk these things out with someone, who has already went through what I am planning to go through, but I don't know, I just ... I just like to have practical, on-the-hands info instead of some general hypothetical mumbo-jumbo, if you know what I mean.

What do you guys think about my plan / goals?

9596,"Stagnating for MONTHS: F26, 173cm/5'6, SW: 92kg/202lbs, CW: 72kg/158lbs, GW 65kg/143lbs.","So... I've been doing IF and OMAD on and off for quite a while now. Started 2 years ago, started IF 1.5 years ago and slowly build up to OMAD. 
My last post here (4 months ago) was full of gratitude and pride. Aaaand I haven't lost a pound since. 

I. am. SO. frustrated. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a teacher, so I don't have alot of spare time and I'm on my feet most of the day. I'm also studying (my employer/school is giving me the opportunity to get an extra degree so I would be stupid to not take this chance) and running a household. Safe to say that taking up a hobby/sport would be too much. I feel like I can't work fulltime as a teacher, study for an extra degree, run a household and still have time for myself to go running or take on a new sport. 

Even though I know I need to do something to lose those last kgs/pounds, I feel stuck and don't know what to do or how to cope. 
I haven't lost anything since November 2020 and I'm wondering how long can a person stagnate in weight... I do fluctuate, but I'm always around 72kgs... 

I do feel that moving in together with my bf did some ""damage"" (damaging sounds so bad: I'm having the time of my life with him and he is very supportive of me losing weight even though he repeatedly says I'm good where I'm at weightwise). He bakes the best goddamn desserts and breads. Before moving in together I did 20:4 IF and cheated in the weekends. Since moving in together I do OMAD every weekday+Saturday (even though we do visit his mom and she cooks three course meals) and cheat on Sunday. And it's not like I binge for crazy on a Sunday... just breakfast (home made slice of bread with butter and honey or chocolate spread) and dinner + (home made) dessert. And my weight is stuck on 72kgs. I'm going to start walking more during my cheat Sundays, hoping it will help. 

Sometimes I look back from where I came. I really need to remind myself that I have lost 20kgs and went from a BMI 30.2 (obese) to BMI 23.5 normal weight... because I feel the urge to binge and stress eat returning. Because I feel like whatever I'm doing isn't paying off anymore and it's really putting me down. I'm really afraid that I'm going to start binge or start stress-eating again.... 

Thanks for coming to my very frustrated TED-talk. 
How do you guys cope with stagnating and getting stuck? Any tips or tricks to loose the last kgs/lbs with a ridiculously busy lifestyle? How to get out of the frustrated/bad mindset? How do you guys keep yourselves from falling of the wagon and keep going?",intermittentfasting,1619435468

9599,On cravings,"I wanted to share with you my revelations on how to minimise cravings during or around IF. 

&amp;#x200B;

*TL:DR - cutting added sugars basically made my appetite disappear.* 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I should state that I'm not currently keeping an IF diet. I tried 16:8 for months on end last year, but it became hard to keep up with a baby to take care of and an SO who likes to eat later than 8. If it was her turn to cook, I basically had to drag her into the kitchen like a neanderthal to have the food ready on time. Moreover, I wasn't seeing much in the way of results and I often struggled tremendously with cravings near the end of the fasting period. I also saw the eating window as an excuse to binge on crap foods. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeing a lot of success stories on this sub (big props to those of course!), but I bet there's a few out there who've had struggles similar to mine. However, the reason I'm posting here is, I think I've now found the breakthrough that reduces cravings to almost zero, so that I'm now confident of having another go at 16:8 in which the cravings and binges won't be such an issue. The key? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sugar**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds anticlimactic? Obvious even? Maybe. But hear me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

When my SO was pregnant with our second earlier this year, she was bingeing hard on all sorts of cakes, cookies, ice cream and basically every sugary food you can think of. I never really had much of a sweet tooth, but I'm the sort who will snack on whatever's in the house. So, I soon found myself bingeing with her. And, pretty soon after, I started to feel these incredible cravings for cookies and cakes. We have a super market across the road, so I often found myself just popping in for a few donuts, apple turnovers, almond pastries etc. like some sort of junkie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the peculiar thing about my body is that I don't lose weight easily but I don't gain it that easily either. Even with all this bingeing, I only gained about two kilos. However, I felt a lot worse, and I seemed to be experiencing a lot of irritation in my bowels and loose stools.  So after a while, I decided it was time to quit the biscuit binges once and for all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read once before that sugar (or, more precisely, high-GI foods) causes insulin spikes that paradoxically make you more hungry, so I figured the best way to go about this was to just cut out all foods with ADDED sugar for a week. I figured that once I stabilised these cravings, I could go back to eating sugar in moderation like I always had (two sugars in my coffee, one in my afternoon tea and a few  biscuits a day to go with them). 

&amp;#x200B;

I still ate fruit, and I still had some products with artificial sweeteners in them (coffee, chewing gum), although I cut out my daily can of diet soda. As my focus was on eliminating sugar rather than calorie reduction for this week, I decided to compensate by responding to my cravings with non-sugary snacks: cheese, peanuts, meats etc. I didn't really do anything about my intake of other high-GI foods such as bread or potatoes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The results were stupefying. Although that first week was a struggle, by the end of the week I found that, not only was I not having cravings, *I was barely having any appetite at all*. On the Sunday, I went without eating until dinner time - without even noticing that I wasn't eating! I guess I kind of felt naturally sated almost all the time, like you do right after a meal. The colonic issues are also gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started to wonder whether this was my 'natural state' when not addicted to sugar. Whether, when not exercising (I'm currently recovering from an injury), we need significantly fewer calories to get through the day than our insulin-jonesing minds are telling us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've kept the no-added-sugar diet up since, not even feeling tempted to go back to my 'default' sugar intake let alone the bingeing habits.  I've lost about a kilo in two weeks, which is generally seen as the ideal rate. I'm now skipping breakfast by default, so a consistent 16:8 should be possible. I'm going to get back to my exercise routine (cycling) soon, so it will be interested

&amp;#x200B;

I can heartily recommend trying a 'no-added-sugar-week', even if it's only to check out what  impact sugar is having on your eating habits and cravings. If you do try it, please do reply to this post or send me a PM, I would love to know if it works as well for you as it's doing for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Note on artificial sweeteners:*

As I said, I'm still consuming some artificial sweeteners, mainly in my coffee and via chewing gum. There are some studies that suggest that artificial sweeteners cause the same insulin spikes as sugary foods, by 'tricking the body' that sugar has been consumed. However, that has not been my personal experience.

9600,Mixing fast techniques,"Hi all! I've been (mostly) sticking to a daily 16/8 fast for a while (a good few months), and it seems to work for me. I struggle with snacking and I find the moment I eat, I want to snack. Delaying the start of my eating each day has reduced my snacking. I do sometimes struggle at weekends to stick to 16/8, especially when friends want to go out for breakfast! But anyway. I am considering trialling  24h fasts, mostly to see if I can do it! But I am reluctant to let go of my 16/8 schedule. So, I have some queries about mixing the two techniques.

- can you safely mix fasting techniques? So could I maintain 16/8 most days then do 24 hour fast on, say, Tuesday (Mon Eve dinner &amp; break fast Tuesday Eve dinner? and the same Thursday?

- is there anything to be aware of in terms of physical activity? I enjoy my exercise and do some kind of exercise daily - usually this is 30-45 minutes of yoga on waking, and then either a 30-40 minute bodyweight HIIT session or strength training, or a run (some rest days from running).

9608,Started IF today. I have some questions,"Hey everyone!  I'm not a huge fan of the latest fad diets so when I saw IF, I thought it was just that, another bandwagon for people to jump on.  I'm a huge believer in CICO.  Essentially that's what all diets come down to anyway IMHO

I'm doing 16:8, from 6pm-10am.  SW: 220, GW: 180.  Here are my questions:

1. Does sparkling water with sodium cause any issues with IF?  I think the answer is no, but want to make sure.  
2. Can I change my IF times by an hour?  Meaning, If I eat later due to family getting home later(or anything that might prevent me from eating by 6pm) and I can't eat at 6, but instead eat at 7pm, can I push my morning eat time back an hour and start at 11am.  Or, do I need to stick to the same times every day, why/why not?
3. Anybody on here have issues with low blood sugar?  If so, how does that play into your IF journey?
4. Any tips for a beginner?",intermittentfasting,1619409104
9611,Over 1.5 months in and the hunger pains still aren't mellowing out. Is this normal for anyone else?,"Hey everyone

I've been doing 16:8 and 18:6 fasting for almost 2 months now. I've been eating ~1500 calories a day, mostly veggies, fruit, and healthy fats and protein. Since I'm not too active during weekdays due to my heavy school schedule, I try to eat things that are low calorie but pretty filling. 

I always end my eating schedule at 5pm, but when 8pm rolls around and I get ready to wind down, finish homework, and go to bed, I am absolutely starving. I usually just drink a bunch of water (I've been told I've been drinking too much and overhydrating actually) and force myself to sleep but it does wake me up pretty often. Basically I go to bed starving, wake up starving, and suffer through it until my eating period begins. I also don't binge or graze when it is time to eat if that matters.

Is there any way to get around this? I was reading previous posts and it seems like the hunger goes away about 2 weeks in. 

On the bright side I've lost about 8 pounds since I've started! I just don't want to have to worry about food constantly during my fasting period.

Last night I treated her to take-out Quesediallas, and she swears she put on 3 pounds overnight. I am not a dietary or medical expert, but I believe her body compensates somehow by reducing her caloric burn rate. She has tried all the diets, consulted with dieticians, yet nothing seems to work for her. I really feel badly for her, as weight control comes relatively easy for me.

Also, I‚Äôve always engaged in evening/nighttime snacking and this schedule lets me feel okay doing it. Am I undoing all the benefits of IF by having my eating window so late? Am I throwing off my body‚Äôs natural rhythm?


The physiological factors related to metabolism are geared towards an early start - your insulin sensitivity is at its highest in the morning, and decreases throughout the day. This is one of the large benefits of IF - if you‚Äôre not eating after a set time, you won‚Äôt be late-night snacking, and you won‚Äôt be disturbing your body‚Äôs natural metabolic system. Since insulin sensitivity decreases throughout the day, the later you eat in the day, the more insulin your body will have to produce to deal with the blood sugar effects.",intermittentfasting,1619402304

Sex: Male

Height: 5ft 7""

Waist size: approx 34""
Conditions: Coeliac
Exercise: None whatsoever

I am an extremely fussy eater. My daily meals have been the same for the last 5 years.
Breakfast: Cereal
Dinner: Chicken curry and rice
And I always have a bowl of cereal before bed because of habit, I suppose. I'll also have something small for lunch.

I haven't been following my gluten free diet... at all! But recently, my stomach has been getting sore when I eat gluten, so that's something I'll likely start doing.

I eat pasta, chicken, cereal, rice, and occasionally fish, and curry sauces. I also drink tea and coffee with a bit of low fat milk. Maybe 6 cups of either in one day.

I also eat and drink more crappy foods (red bull, sweets) than is healthy for anyone!

I work 12 hour shifts, including night shifts, and I usually eat a large meal before or during a night shift. Days and nights are 9-9.

I do no exercise at all but I've recently been introduced to an app that will slowly but surely build up my fitness. I figure there's no point in doing exercise without a proper diet.

So I'm looking for advice on how to get going. My portions have, admittedly, been quite large, so I'm going to need advice on, for example, exact measurements of chicken, rice and so on. I never tire of the same foods so that's never going to be an issue for me.

Ok... I can do this... Not the best but, I could do that one a day.

Next I added just 1 tsp ACV to my lemon water (I was a little nervous about the vinegar).  

OMG... How do people do that?!  It was like if someone pickled dirty gym socks!  I held my nose and guzzled the rest (making gagging motions).  How on Earth am I supposed to pull this off with 1-2 TBSP?! I saw one guy suggest adding the lemon and ACV to chamomile tea and a few drops of stevia however, I'm reluctant to add any artificial sweetener (conflicting information on sweetners during the fasting period).

Kind suggestions greatly appreciated.",intermittentfasting,1619370398

9699,"‚ÄúBend, Don‚Äôt Break‚Äù - a few thoughts (and a celebration!) after hitting my first 10 lbs.","Hi all,

I‚Äôm still relatively new to intermittent fasting and healthier eating, but having lost my first 10 pounds, I wanted to share the little mantra (and mindset) that‚Äôs helped me mostly stick to my program and avoid falling off the wagon.

My biggest problem has always been that I tend to binge on junk food, especially *after* a perfectly satisfying meal or at the end of the day. And when I‚Äôve adopted a strict diet, whenever I fail, it usually ends with me mentally throwing up my hands and saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt succeed, so might as well enjoy myself‚Äù and recommence eating terribly.

IF, anywhere from 16:8-20:4 has been the first and easiest sustained weight loss I‚Äôve ever experienced. And I‚Äôve been helped by the mantra ‚ÄúBend, Don‚Äôt Break‚Äù.

If you‚Äôve ever watched an NFL game, you‚Äôve probably heard a broadcaster mention a ‚Äúbend, don‚Äôt break‚Äù defense. In context, the idea is it‚Äôs okay when you inevitably give up smaller gains to the opposing team if, when it counts, you mostly prevent big plays and give up fewer touchdowns. 

Applied to fasting and eating better, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs much better to forgive myself a little indulgence, as often as every single day, if that‚Äôs what helps me stick to the bigger plan of roughly achieving a 16:8 window and eating cleanly (in my case, drastically cutting back on processed carves and sugar).

I may be really hung up about achieving a 20:4 window one day. But come 9am at work, if I‚Äôm stressed and can feel a craving come on, rather than hold out and potentially risk losing control altogether later in the morning, I‚Äôll just break my fast with a handful of peanuts or a piece of fruit. So I didn‚Äôt make 20:4...but I probably just successfully completed a 15 hour fast. Same thing with sweets. Driving home in the afternoon, I still pass all the places I used to routinely stop at for a shake or candy bar. So if I‚Äôm jonesing hard one day, I‚Äôll have some fig newtons or a square of chocolate. And of course then chug some more water or have a seltzer.

I have been following IF along with CICO. While I haven't been counting, I do believe I am consuming below the normal calorie requirement for a human body. 

However, My sleep has been really bad all this time I have been fasting. I used to sleep for 7 hours before I started, but now I am unable to wakeup anytime before 9 or sometimes even 11 hours. I don't feel well rested after a 7 hour sleep and without much control, I end up continuing my sleep for longer. I would like to add that I have no trouble falling or staying asleep. 

Rest of my day is absolutely fine. I don't lack the energy to do anything, and can make it through the fasting period without any problem. My fasting time is between 4 PM and 8 PM. I have been drinking more than 3 L of water. I also started consuming some electrolytes on the side just to see if that was the issue, but it has made no difference.

But now I am dealing with electrolyte issues even though I think I get plenty in my diet (althought maybe not enough).

Also, does it make more sense to take casein (chosen for its sustained release) in the morning or at night or both? Or does that even matter at all?

First few hours weren‚Äôt hard, I checked my BG when I woke up. I had decided to take the medicine I usually take (except laxative) the night before. I started drinking magnesium supplemented water and even got to the toilet so I was happy (but it might have been the extra Metformin from the night before lol).    

But that is until I decided to get my 10000 daily steps and walk around my place, I felt lightheadedness so I checked my BG again (normal). I decided to look up a bit and read advice to take breaks if it happens and just ‚Äúrest‚Äù so I drank some more water and instead of walking for over 30minutes broke it down in quarters. I decided to try doing a light workout during my fast, I checked my BG just after I was done with it and it had risen to 100, thanks cortisol even though I did not push through it whatsoever.    

Then the hardest part was evening/nighttime: I started getting nauseous and bad headaches, on the verge of a migraine. I drank a bit more and tried to not freak out.    
Before going to bed I checked my BG again it had lowered to 80. I was thinking the next morning (today) it would have gotten down and I had an appointment in the morning I needed to go to. I honestly thought I would break the fast by eating fruit so I could go on.

I prepared my lunch (all the ‚Äúwhat to eat after a fast‚Äù I found were for longer fasts and basically keto stuff which I‚Äôm not doing so that was not going to happen), and checked my BG before I ate it was at 93.

Long time lurker here. I figured since I'm having a little success and feeling great, I should share what has been working for me up to this point and possibly post once a week to hold myself accountable. Here is what I have been doing for the last 6 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I complete at least one 30-40 hour fast per week (sometimes two), 4-5 days that are a mixture of OMAD or two meals in 4 hours, and one day off, usually on Saturdays, where I eat whatever I'm wanting for lunch and dinner.
2. I allow myself 1 ten calorie energy drink per day as a treat. The rest of the day I drink only water and I usually drink quite a bit of it.
3. Except for Saturdays, I generally eat beef, grilled chicken breast, cheese, eggs (mostly egg whites), and veggies. I cook these foods in butter or coconut oil.
4. I have been working out 3-4 times a week for about an hour a day. My favorite workout is to walk for 2 minutes, followed by one minute of a variety of weight lifting exercises and then I repeat that for 45 minutes to an hour.

My weekly losses up to now have been -

1. Week 1 - 9.2lbs
2. Week 2 - 8.2lbs
3. Week 3 - 3.8lbs
4. Week 4 - 6.6lbs
5. Week 5 - 1.0lbs
6. Week 6 - 6.4lbs

Since I am very heavy, I didn't begin seeing changes in my body until I had lost 25 pounds, but now I'm seeing changes regularly. I even had to buy new, smaller shorts because my others were falling off while walking. It's really fun to be on the right path for a change.

I started 18:6 five weeks ago, no calorie counting but I usually had a small snack around 4 PM (something like 5-6 crackers with hummus) and then dinner around 7. No junk food but nothing overly healthy, maybe some lentil stew, pasta with pesto, black bean burrito, stuff like that. I cheated on weekends (beer) and was going over due to that and losing no weight, so I switched OMAD 2 weeks ago, stopped drinking mostly (I'll have a glass of red on a Friday night but that's it and within my calorie limit) and have been tracking my calories via an app. 

It's not always easy to find German foods in the app but I try to substitute best I can and so I've been trying to be as accurate as possible and tracking 800-1000 calories a day. I drink black coffee around 3-4 cups a day, and one 1.5L bottle of water, usually I have diet soda with dinner. So liquids I'm drinking probably 3.5L a day.

9847,Dirty fasting choices - do carbs matter if you're not otherwise doing keto?,"I've only been doing IF for two weeks so far.  I've been doing 18/6 most days, 20/4 some days, but I've been doing what I guess is called dirty fasting since there is no way in hell I'm giving up my morning dirty chai. 

I've done keto and calorie counting  before and had good luck with it, but I get kind of obsessive and  am not currently ready to go down that road quite yet. I figure I'll save it for the inevitable stall down the road. So for now while I've tried to reduce simple sugars, sweets and just be very aware about what I eat.  I'm not having any trouble at all this far with IF and actually feel great. 

So here's the actual question - the dirty chai I have on the morning used a 0 calorie sucralose based chai concentrate, espresso and I've been using an amount of oat milk that is about 35 calories but plenty of carbs.  However, it hasn't caused me any cravings or crashes. Would I be better off switching to half and half  with slightly more calories but a lot fewer carbs? I figure since I'm having this drink while I'm still ""fasting"" (yes i know i'm not really) maybe it's better to keep it keto-ish? Or does it just not matter since I'm not keto the rest of the time?

9875,Is it a bad idea to only do IF some days?,"I've been trying to do beginner's 16:8 IF - basically skipping breakfast and not snacking after dinner- which is usually pretty easy - except when I'm trying to go jogging in the morning. If I run without eating at least a mini granola bar, I get noticeably more tired earlier in the run, and afterward late in the morning I feel shaky and even bordering on lightheaded - making me wonder if it's a low blood sugar thing. It has only happened a few times, and then I started eating something small in the morning before going out for a run, and it went away. But if I kept running without eating in the morning, would that shaky feeling eventually go away? And for IF in general, is it a bad idea to only do it on some days? I've heard if you eat at the same time every day your body gets used to it, so not sure if I'm undermining that by having a granola bar a couple mornings a week.",intermittentfasting,1613926506

9894,Combining traditional eating with 1 day fasts?,"I'm pretty happy with my normal eating (balanced meals, large breakfast, small lunch, medium dinner) and can adjust my calories if I need to lose weight/maintaine etc. I tend to be able to keep my weight at OK levels(between healthy BMI and mid overweight BMI but nothing too worrisome) though I do drift up in weight when going through times of stress which means I start to pay more attention and cut back or even count calories to get back to more my ideal.

That said I'm intrigued by some of the benefits of fasting such as lower basal insulin levels, lower basal hunger levels, possible other benefits. 

My goal is good health and a more natural easy maintenance where I don't gain weight in times of stress as easily.

That said, when I've tried a little IF and it didn't work well at all for me and I felt it hurt my relationship with food more than it helped. I was irritable and not as quick witted and when I did eat, I tended to want more junk and had less ability to stop myself. It felt wrong so I stopped. I will say what I did was basically eat my breakfast but then skip lunch until a late dinner. I did lose weight but it was miserable for me. I know people usually skip breakfast but that seems like a waste if I eat dinner which is my least favorite meal and the one I'm most likely to eat less balanced at / more junk.

Now I'm thinking maybe I should aim to eat normally with occasional 36 hour fasts (normal dinner one day, skip eating a day, and normal breakfast the next) just for the health benefits and for the slight weight loss.

Anyway, is this feasible? Is there any actual benefit? Do I need to drink anything except water during a fast (electrolytes?) ? Thank you!",intermittentfasting,1613912626

I visited the doctor and was told I had low vitamin D, low iron and high prolactin levels. I finished my treatment a couple of weeks ago.


2 days ago I decided to give intermittent fasting a try. I found the 16:8 a convenient one for me.

Some bread, omelet and even a steak sometimes.

1. Will these high carb foods affect my progress even if I eat them within the eight hour frame.?

When you shed pounds (I‚Äôve lost about 60 and am sitting at 161 lbs, M 6‚Äô0‚Äù) people are a lot more vocal. In quite a few cases it‚Äôs positive affirmation, which is nice. But strangely often the same body-judges from when you were larger now judge your weight loss. 

‚ÄúAre you Ill?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too skinny. ‚Äú

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be eating more?‚Äù

And the common:

‚ÄúAre you starving yourself?‚Äù

In that latter case I‚Äôve taken to answering ‚Äúnope, just skipping breakfast.‚Äù

Usually I skip breakfast anyways but it‚Äôs been hard to consciously avoid eating until 12

Will keep updates on progress :)",intermittentfasting,1627536644
9977,What effect does breaking your fast with a few calories have?,"I sometimes take melatonin gummies at night, and I‚Äôve read here that the 15 calories will ‚Äúbreak the fast.‚Äù I know the obvious difference is I‚Äôll have had a few calories, but are there any real potential benefits lost from this? Thanks",intermittentfasting,1627535625
9978,"I experienced dizziness, stomach cramps, and sweating after breaking my 16 hour fast with juice.","I usually do a 16:8 fast everyday with the occasional cheat day. I eat between 2-10 pm. 

I was microwaving my food, and got some orange juice. I had a couple of sips, and after 2 minutes I had some painful stomach cramps, shakiness, dizziness, and felt hot. I had to lie down so I ran upstairs to my bathroom and laid down on the tile, and noticed my upper body was extremely sweaty and felt cold. I stayed there for a few minutes, the cramps subsided and I felt fine. 

I can‚Äôt find much online about this so I was wondering if anyone happened to know the cause of this? I did some reading about postprandial hypotension but things online say it occurs after eating.. thanks!",intermittentfasting,1627531428
9979,Is it normal to have a decreased appetite after doing IF for a while?,"Hey everyone! I've been doing 16:8 fasting pretty consistently since July 4th; I did fast for a shorter time for a few days last week due to some changes in my schedule but still stopped eating at 8 pm. I've noticed a significant drop in my appetite the last week in particular and just wanted to ask if this is normal? I'm not opposed to it at all bc it's also helping me keep my calorie deficit but I want to make sure that it's normal, and not a sign of my metabolism decreasing or anything like that. If it is normal, how long can I expect it to last? Will my appetite stay decreased as long as I'm doing IF?

Thank you in advance to anyone who answers!",intermittentfasting,1627530667
9980,I want to take a break for a few days,"So I have done if for 2 months now, I want to take a break from it for 2-3 days and then get back on it again from 1st August . ( I have lost 10 kgs , with if and running , weighted yesterday )
Reason for break - I want to start rolling 36s, but after I finished my 1st one yesterday, I don't feel like doing one today. It basically got me into starting phase where doing 18hr was tough, feeling same right now.
Help me !! Plz !!",intermittentfasting,1627529945
9982,New to fasting,"Hi everyone!

I generally wake up around 7 and am in bed by 11, does any have any times that they think would suite this type of schedule?

9985,Newbie Here: I have questions,"Hi all - first time poster; long time lurker. Ok, so I'm currently reading ""Fast, Feast, Repeat"" by Gin Stephens. I've also heard some advice from medical professionals on podcasts, articles, etc. I searched FAQ's but didn't see some of these, so was looking for help. Stats: 5'9"" Female; CW: 182; GW: 160, I workout 2x a week. Ok, here goes:

1. Gin does strictly clean fast because even a whiff of flavored tea/coffee (i.e. vanilla flavored coffee beans) triggers an insulin response. And because we don't gulp coffee/sodas in one instance, we are continuing the triggered response as long as we drink it. She says, if we had one gulp, our insulin would turn off in about 15 minutes. So, assuming that is true, can I have one shot of espresso with milk (\~30 cal) and still maintain my  current fast? Or eat one strawberry or one bite of cereal (all under 50 cal)? If not, does the clock start over to zero or just the 15-30 minutes of insulin response and then I pick up the autophagy/good stuff after?
2. Let's say I absolutely have to break my fast (I'm about to pass out or gun to my head). What is the best type of thing to eat on this journey (protein, fat, carb, etc.)? Should I gobble down food quickly or once I've broken the fast, it doesn't matter and I can do whatever until my next fasting window?
3. Does the amount of insulin/glycogen released depend on the amount of food you eat, or the caloric intake, or it doesn't matter? When I break my fast, if I eat 2 egg whites vs. a brownie, do I get back into autophagy/through my insulin storages faster with the healthier meal? Or is it roughly 12 hours no matter what you eat (and it's based on time?).

Thanks y'all! Appreciate this sub for all of the insights.",intermittentfasting,1627518435
9986,"Applying ""Atomic Habits"" to Fasting, Fitness, &amp; Health","A few years ago I read James Clear's fantastic book, ""Atomic Habits"".  It has tons of practical advice about improving your habits, all based on research.

Lately I've been thinking about how to apply the principles from that book to fasting and other health-related stuff.  

I wrote a blog post on the topic (link at the bottom), but here are a few thoughts to consider:  

Habits strongly influence everything we do. That includes health-related things like nutrition, exercise, sleep, meditation, and even fasting.  

The best way to improve your health?

Make small, sustainable changes to your health-related habits, one little bit at a time. As those little improvements gradually build up, they become part of your new identity, and eventually lead to an amazing transformation.

I think my favorite advice from Atomic Habits is to make any new habit really easy at the beginning.

For example, if you're not used to exercising, but you want to get started, don't try going to the gym for an hour everyday. It would be too big of a disruption to your usual routine, so you probably wouldn't stick with it for more than a couple days. (In other words, it's like a typical New Year's resolution.)

Instead, make a commitment to exercise for at least 5 minutes every day, and use a chart or calendar to track your progress. It's such a small commitment that it won't feel overwhelming, but it allows your brain to start adapting to a new routine. Once you've become consistent, then you can work on improving the habit (like exercising a little longer, or increasing the intensity).

The same approach works for other health-related habits as well. Like fasting, meditation, and basically anything else you can think of.

""Make new habits easy"" is just one piece of advice from the book ‚Äî but there's a bunch of other useful info.

If you'd like to check out my detailed summary (which includes key points from each chapter and a bunch of examples of how you can use those principles to improve your health), here's the link:

9987,Keto + IF questions,"I am doing keto and I am going to add 16/8 IF to my life again. I was doing just IF and down 30 but you know quarantine ü§¨
My questions are: 
1) do you set a specific macro for your eating window? For instance, Carb Manager says I should have 100 protein, 125 fats, 20 net carbs and 1600 cal.  How do I translate this to 8 hour window? Just fit those amounts in 8 hours? Or is it less? Thanks",intermittentfasting,1627517392
9989,Water Addatives?,"So I've done a few fasts (3 days, e/o) but I'd be lying if I said I enjoy plain water. I can literally drink plain water until I get sick cause my body doesn't know or tell me when to stop. When I casually drink water I usually add MIO or something for flavor. Is there something like that I can use while fasting?",intermittentfasting,1627512216
9991,not really hungry during eating window.. should I just decrease the window?,"currently experimenting with 16:8 and honestly, I'm not really hungry during my eating window. like I just eat cuz I'm tired or I should since it's breakfast time (all not reasons to eat as I'm trying to lose weight).

should I just drop down to 20:4 or OMAD? I'm worried as I'm a woman and I've heard the most number of hours is 16:8 or else it'll ruin menstrual cycle, which I'm already pretty irregular",intermittentfasting,1627510458
9993,The Tortoise and The Hare,"Mr Demotivater paid me a visit recently to remind me that slow results are unfavourable in comparison to instant gratification - the audacity! I agree in some respects: wouldn‚Äôt it be fabulous if we all just wished a goal to be true and abracadabra it‚Äôs done. So let‚Äôs take a walk on the scrubby-grass side, admire the discarded rubbish and run-down buildings and get some perspective. 
Is it really worth scaling the fence to get to the luscious meadow beyond if that fence is a tangle of fatigue, undernourishment and rebounds? Is the end goal so important that you‚Äôd sacrifice your mental and physical well-being? Even the hare didn‚Äôt think so, he took a rest halfway through and ended up finishing after the tortoise. 
It‚Äôs not so bad on this side of the fence. Sure, it‚Äôs not idyllic but at least it‚Äôs real. On second look those scrubby-grasses could be wild flowers in need a wee drop of water. 
So, Mr Demotivater, kindly feck off. Slow progress *is* progress and it‚Äôs only you who thinks otherwise. Go sit on your astroturf and spout your useless falsehoods to the breeze coming off your handheld fan ya fake-ass clown.",intermittentfasting,1627507821
